{"name": "Terry Acree", "position": "Professor, Food Science", "summary": "Terry Acree`s laboratory is interested in how stimulant composition is represented in perception. A seemingly infinite number of perceptions are invoked by less than 1000 odorants found in the human sensory environment. Mediated by sensory neurons expressing a given receptor these odorants generate neural excitation in the brain that is a topographic map of sensory information. Recent literature suggest that olfactory receptor expression is highly variant in the human population and that this may explain the functional variation in taste and olfaction that has been observed for decades. Understanding the relationship between stimulant composition and perception is therefore central to understanding the representation of chemical information in the brain and the impact of genetic diversity on the perception of food.\nAn internal representation of the external world is created in the brain of all eukaryotes by a mechanism that detects chemicals in the environment and transmit this information to the brain, where it is processed to create, at least in humans, perceptions. This sensory representation of the external chemical world in the brain is a translation of stimulus features into a neural sensory map. It is the nature of this sensory map: how it is established by stimulant patterns, how it varies in a population, and ultimately how it modulates other brain functions, e.g. emotions (joy) or behavior (buying wine), that is the goal of our research. Over the years Terry and his students have developed a selective and sensitive bio-assay for smell based on gas chromatography - olfactometry (GCO) called CharmAnalysis that, along with other forms of chromatography, spectrometry, and sensory analysis, are used to study food quality.\nStarting with Gas Chromatography Olfactometry we analyzed the most potent odorants in foods in order to understand how flavor perception works in humans. Reciently, we have developed a new tool the Sniff Olfactometer (SO) to study the perception of odorants in mixtures. We have confirmed that odor images are formed from a small subset of \"Key\" odorants during the first 100 ms after an encounter. Using Psychophysical experiments involving the SO and key odorants from foods we are studying the temporal effects of odorant mixtures on odor image formation and relating response to hedonic state. We intend to create tools and knowledge that improves food quality, to stimulate more effective culinary, but most of all to create knowledge that will give consumers the power to change their preferences, improve their health and to enhance their quality of life.\nFood producers, cooks, and consummers want to understand how flavor chemistry impacts their profits or how flavor is formed or what pleasure is produced during eating. Our outreach gives people tools, e.g. identifies the chemicals that determine flavor, explains how flavor affects choice and proposes processes to manipulate it.\nMy teaching strives to present good explanations of the sensory and psychological responses to food chemicals. Lectures emphasize the connections between chemical stimulants and sensory responses and are accompanied with experiences (taste, smell, visual) that exemplify the explanations.", "courses_taught": ["DoctorateCornell University - 1968", "Master of ScienceCornell University - 1965", "Bachelor of ArtsUniversity of California Berkeley - 1963", "AASContra Costa Junior College - 1961", "Honorary Member 2010 Society of Flavor Chemists", "FDSC 6960: Graduate Internship in Food Science", "FDSC 5000: Master of Professional Studies (Agriculture) Project", "FDSC 6010: Principles and Applications of Food Science and Technology", "FDSC 4990: Undergraduate Research in Food Science"], "news_items": []},

After studies at Cambridge and London Universities, which included botany and plant pathology, I did postdoctoral research in California. I came to Cornell as an assistant professor of plant pathology in 1970. Since then my work has focused on the apple tree, its origins and its diseases. I have also tried to pass on some of my enthusiasm to as many students as I can. I have been particularly interested in improving the apple tree`s ability to stand up for itself against the assaults of myriad diseases, with doing harm to the rest of our wonderful environment. This has led me into close association with apple breeders, with whom I have helped develop varieties with better resistance to diseases. It also led me to explore for wild apples in Central Asia, where we know now the domestic apple originated. As a result we have assembled an excellent collection of apples from the wild, which will be a valuable source of genes to use in future. In recent years we have explored the use of biotechnology to strengthen apple varieties. This promises to be of great value as we gain a much better understanding of the genes in apple trees and how they work, through genomics studies. We have also tried to gain a better understanding of the diseases, so that we can counter them with improved methods. We have paid particular attention to the devastating fire blight disease, which was first found in New York and continues to be the most feared disease of apple trees here and elsewhere.", "courses_taught": ["ISHS Recognition Award 2010 ISHS International Workshop on Fire Blight"], "news_items": []},

{"name": "Mike Bishop", "position": "Ph.D. Candidate, Development Sociology, Department of Global Development", "summary": "I believe the insights of White anti-racist allies can work to change the stories being told in rural communities that dehumanize Black and Indigenous peoples.  I am investigating how social relations and social movements for human dignity manifest in these sparsely populated regions that have dependent economic, political, and social relationships with regional metropoles.  My project is a dialogical narrative analysis with ally genesis stories shared by a group of White anti-racist activists living in the North Country of New York state. What do these stories tell us about White settler allies “holding their own” in their anti-racist activism in a specific place and time? Can they play a role in healing the brokenness of privilege-informed trauma across intersectional social identities, especially race and class? What are the limits of extrapolating allyship vis a vis patriarchy and White supremacy?  In my work I confront my positionality as a university-based researcher. I also address: \nMy research is grounded in the understanding that race is the defining feature in rural United States, an often invisible construct that provides rural people of European descent – settlers – with a sense of power, regardless of their class standing. While I aim to answer questions of interest to both the field and to communities, as an anti-racist community organizer involved in movements for human dignity, I want to change the stories being told in rural communities toward a more humanizing narrative. \nWhite supremacy movements also are using stories such as the great replacement to make life more dangerous for people of color and Indigenous peoples, especially in rural areas that are more geographically isolated. What does their embrace by most rural White people show about the interactions between rural institutions and political and economic elites who live and work in urban areas? How do these stories allow White people to place themselves at the center of the capitalist project? And how are some people able to resist their socialization into White supremacy culture?\nI have dedicated my entire working life to serving the public good, and see my purpose as strengthening democracy.

He has been and continues to be actively engaged in the Biology Curriculum and is the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Biochemistry and Molecular and Cell Biology Programs of Studies.\nI first began teaching as an undergraduate teaching assistant at Cornell. After that experience which spanned several semesters, it was clear to me that teaching was the career that I wanted to pursue. I, therefore, consider myself incredibly fortunate to be teaching at Cornell. As an employee, I have been teaching since 1981. I first taught laboratories in biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology. I then began teaching survey courses in biochemistry. The goal of these courses is to expose students to the major groups of biologically important molecules with a special emphasis on the protein enzymes that catalyze most biologically important reactions. My main focus became the Individualized Instruction course in Biochemistry (BIOMG 3300). It is staffed by myself and a small army of undergraduate TAs most of whom have taken the class, performed at a very high level, and realized their passion for the subject. One of my major responsibilities for the class is to organize and train this group of TAs who then go out and provide personalized instruction to the students enrolled in the class. Both the TA class (BIOMG 4980) and the student class (BIOMG 3300) are extremely popular and I take pride in being associated with them.\nOn the “side”, I teach a “seminar style” class to enhance the learning of our biochemistry students (BIOMG 3340). A major focus of this class is the use of computer graphics to learn about the structure and function of biologically important molecules. As is true for BIOMG 3300, we use a large variety of active learning techniques. Because I felt as an undergraduate at Cornell that there were not enough opportunities for students to gain public speaking experience. I made it a priority to include a public speaking assignment in the class.\nMany years ago, I spent my summer months teaching molecular biology to high school biology teachers as part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute funded Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers (CIBT). More recently, I have taught a wide variety of classes as part of the Cornell Summer Session including a senior-level and a freshman-level survey course in cell Biology (BIOMG 1350 and BIOMG 4320), and a lecture course in Biochemistry (BIOMG 3330).\nI try to stay up to date on new teaching technologies by attending teaching oriented workshops. This sometimes involves travel but more often includes attendance at workshops offered locally by the Center for Teaching Excellence. To the extent possible, I include the new techniques into my classes. Since that is not always feasible, I have occasionally created such opportunities by teaching BIOMG 1250, a short course on HIV, Immunology, and Drug Design that I developed for freshmen in the biological sciences. This has given me the opportunity to play with flipped classroom techniques, including the use of case studies.\nI am the Director of Undergraduate Studies for two concentrations within the Biology major: Biochemistry and Molecular/Cell Biology. In this role, I have played an active part in the evolution of the new biology curriculum and its assessment.\nI advise a large number of students including both freshmen and upperclassmen. In this role, I try to stay up to date on program requirements and to make myself as accessible to my advisees as is humanly possible.", "courses_taught": ["Master of ScienceCornell University - 1992", "Bachelor of ScienceCornell University - 1979", "Stephen H.

My research activities involve many animal models (mouse, sheep and cattle), based on the fact that each offers unique opportunities and unique metabolic challenges. My research has implications for both animal agriculture and human health.\nThe overall goal of my research program is to understand the regulation of metabolism, growth and development by hormones. We pursue this goal at molecular, cellular and organismal levels in the context of problems relevant to animal agriculture and medicine. At the present time, my research efforts are focused on 3 specific areas. 1) Hormonal coordination of metabolism in energy deficient ruminants: Dairy cattle experience dramatic changes in metabolism during the period from pregnancy to lactation when they enter a period of severe nutritional insufficiency. The goal of this research program is to identify the roles of growth hormone (GH) and leptin in inducing beneficial adaptations in the early lactating dairy cows. 2) Effect of fetal under-nutrition on postnatal energy metabolism: Epidemiological studies of human populations link fetal under-nutrition to juvenile obesity and chronic diseases during adult life. The goal of this research is to identify causal relation between intrauterine under-nutrition, impaired fetal hypothalamic development and postnatal obesity using a sheep model. 3) Regulation and function of vascular insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I): IGF-I is necessary for normal body growth and for the development of specific tissues (muscle, bone, mammary gland, etc) and is involved in diseases such as cancer and diabetes and in the aging process. The goal of this research is to identify the role played by liver derived IGF-I in various genetically engineered mice models subjected to anabolic or catabolic conditions.\nI teach Biology of the Mammary Gland in Health and Disease ( ANSC/BIOAP 3410).

Specific examples includes the solution behavior of biopolymers, the factors which determine secondary and tertiary structure in polymers, enzymatic reaction mechanisms, rational drug design, the effects of point mutations in proteins, and the possibility of engineering desirable modifications in the function of wild-type proteins. In our work we use the techniques of computational theoretical chemistry to numerically model the properties of biopolymers and solutions. These techniques, often called Molecular Mechanics, include computer graphics-based molecular docking, energy minimization and conformational energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations.\nMy teaching activities focus on food chemistry and the chemistry of carbohydrates in foods and in other biological systems.

Like many host-specific plant pathogens, P. syringae is a \"stealth\" parasite that can multiply for several days in host tissues before symptoms, such as necrotic spots, develop. We have learned that the ability of P. syringae to multiply in the intercellular spaces of plant leaves and cause disease is dependent on a \"type III\" secretion system that injects virulence effector proteins into host cells. Variants of this injector system are also used by many important animal pathogens (for example, Yersinia pestis, the plague pathogen) to deliver their virulence proteins. What is the complete repertoire of effectors and injectisome components secreted by P. syringae? How do effectors subvert host defenses? What other adaptations does this sophisticated parasite have for life in plants? To answer these questions, we and a team of researchers from the USDA/ARS Plant-Microbe Interaction research group at Cornell and the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research have been characterizing the genome sequence of DC3000 and developing a variety of bioinformatic, biochemical, genetic, and cell biological tools to support a genome-wide study of virulence mechanisms and to foster functional genomic investigations by the worldwide research community.", "courses_taught": [], "news_items": []},

To address this, I have been working with one of the most relevant models that continues to impact human health worldwide—the insect vector Aedes aegypti. I apply a wide range of well-established molecular techniques and innovative omics science tools.\nBefore joining the Buchon Lab, my academic journey was primarily focused on understanding various cellular mechanisms such as endocytosis and autophagy during the vector/human cycle of neglected tropical diseases with global health importance, including Chagas, ZIKV, and DENV viruses, as well as insect physiology itself. As a postdoc, I began working on the development of new vaccine technologies using synthetic mRNAs. In this translational research project, I was involved in all stages of molecular and immunological assays, utilizing state-of-the-art technologies.\nAltogether, my previous background and current research project will contribute to the scientific community's understanding of how the insect immune response is modulated by infection. It aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in stem cell activity, tissue homeostasis/repair and provide valuable knowledge that can be utilized as a strategy for disease control.", "courses_taught": [], "news_items": []},

To this end, I am excited by the many lessons our dynamic ecosystems and fellow organisms have to teach us about resilience, niche partitioning, and multifunctionality. I have experience examining the influence of on-farm biodiversity in diversified vegetable and dairy farms through beetle banks and native meadows. I also have expertise in microplastic pollution in terrestrial systems, with a particular focus on soil microfiber contamination from sewage sludge and irrigation and how they affect crops.\nMy research at Cornell is situated within both the Weed Ecology and Management & Sustainable Cropping Systems Labs. I am currently leading a multi-institutional project investigating how to improve the yield and weed suppression of perennial grain cropping systems. Perennial grains more efficiently use water and nutrients, reduce soil erosion, and require less rounds of planting and tilling than annual grains. They can also be grown as diverse polycultures that provide forage and reduce pest pressure. However, perennials establish slower than annuals and divest more resources to plant organs besides the grain, leading to lower yields than annual grains and greater competition with weeds. Therefore, it is important to understand how perennial grains can be best maintained to diminish yield losses. Our work investigates how seeding rate of the perennial grain Kernza can be modified to maximize yields and improve weed suppression, which will promote their adoption and economic viability for farmers.\nLong term, I aim to promote curiosity-driven, hands-on outdoor learning at an institutional level as a professor. I strongly believe developing an intuition for and connection with nature is a critical tool to addressing systemic issues in environmental and social inequality, while developing creative, well-rounded, and compassionate thinkers.

We described a new class of small non-coding RNAs in mammals that map to the promoters and the bodies of protein coding genes and might be involved in regulation of gene expression. Our discoveries led to the description of an alternative RNA capping process, which leads to 7mG capping of cleaved transcripts independently of transcription.

My grandfathers were both scientists: one a geologist, Dr. Odell McGuire, at Washington and Lee University where I grew up in Virginia, and the other an Ecology professor, Dr. Dick Root, here at Cornell. Through them and my father, who is an avid outdoorsman, I developed a deep love of nature, animals, and science, and decided to pursue a career in biology. I graduated from Wells College and spent some time teaching science at the middle and high school levels before ultimately returning to my happy place, the research laboratory.

Data from this study is being compiled and analyzed with data from another survey site in the U.S. and is being prepared for publication.\nThe focus of our Extension/Outreach program is to provide the principles of food safety assurance to all sectors of the food system and assist constituents in agricultural production, food processing, food retailing, food service, government agencies and consumers with practical and useful information to assure the safety of foods.\nIn recent years, the concepts of food protection and defense (food biosecurity) have been incorporated into our extension/outreach programs. In addition, the best practices for communicating the risks involved in food product recalls, as well as catastrophic food events, have been shared with a variety of food industry and regulatory agency officials.\nThe focus of my teaching program is to stimulate student interest in, and enthusiasm for food science and food safety through the use of innovative technologies (electronic student polling, video clips, etc.) and instructional methods. I currently teach a course in Food Safety Assurance, co-teach Food Choices and Issues, a popular course where the relationship between food, diet and health, food technology, and contemporary food issues are addressed and also teach a course on Leadership and Career Skills in Food Science. This leadership course is unique and is the only one taught within a Food Science curriculum in the country. It is designed for second semester Food Science majors and provides students with opportunities to assess their personality types, the strengths that they possess, as well as their leadership behaviors and reinforce how these indicators can be used in their daily activities. I also guest lecture in several other courses in Food Science, Nutritional Sciences and Crop and Soil Sciences.", "courses_taught": ["DoctorateCornell University - 1975", "Master of ScienceCornell University - 1969", "Bachelor of ScienceRutgers University - 1967", "Certificate of Appreciation (2015) New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, Division of Food Safety and Inspection", "Certificate of Appreciation (2015) U.S. Department of Agriculture", "The Calvert Willey Distinguished Service Award (2014) Institute of Food Technologists", "The Emmett R.

{"name": "Susan Henry", "position": "Dean Emeritus, Molecular Biology and Genetics", "summary": "Susan Henry was the Ronald P. Lynch Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) at Cornell from July 1, 2000 until June 30, 2010 when she returned full time to her position of Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics. Susan Henry conducts research on genetic regulation of lipid metabolism in yeast. Her research is funded by the National Institutes of Health.\nThe research in Susan Henry’s laboratory focuses on regulation of membrane lipid metabolism in yeast and its coordination with membrane trafficking and signal transduction (Jesch et al., 2006; Gaspar et al., 2006; Gaspar et al., 2008; Nunez et al., 2008; Gaspar et al, 2010; Villa et al, 2010). We have shown that signals arising from lipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane influence major transcriptional networks in the cell (Gaspar et al., 2006a; Jesch et al., 2006; Jesch et al., 2005; Loewen et al., 2004,Jesch et al, 2010). This metabolism influences, and is influenced by, several major signal transduction pathways including the unfolded protein response pathway (Chang et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2002) and the protein-kinase (PKC) pathway (Sreenivas et al., 2001, Nunez et al., 2008, Jesch et al.2010) and the glucose response pathway (Shirra et al., 2001).\nOur work has focused on the relationship of transcriptional and metabolic responses to the phospholipid precursor, inositol. The transcription patterns of over 700 genes are altered within two hours (equivalent to about one doubling time) following introduction of inositol. Statistical analysis identified at least six distinct expression responses (Jesch et al., 2005, 2006) including repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes regulated by Opi1p, as well as genes regulated by the UPR pathway and transient induction of lipid remodeling genes regulated by Mga2p. These three categories of genes are known to respond to signals arising in the ER and the kinetics of the changes in their transcript abundance were rapid, occurring within the first 15 to 30 minutes following introduction of inositol. Analysis of changes in lipid metabolism over the same time frame revealed rapid consumption of phosphatidic acid (PA) which was shown to interact with Opi1p and to be required for its retention in the ER (Loewen et al., 2004). Consumption of PA results in translocation of Opi1p to the nucleus and repression of phospholipid biosynthetic genes including INO1.\nCells defective in Protein Kinase C (PKC) signaling proved to be unable to adapt to growth in the absence of inositol. Wild type cells shifted to inositol-free medium activate PKC signaling via the Mpk1p protein kinase and the Rlm1p transcription factor, upregulating a number of Rlm1p target genes. Cells defective in PKC signaling are unable to mount this transcription response to inositol deficiency and also exhibit major changes in lipid metabolism (Nunez et al., 2008). Interruption of inositol sphingolipid synthesis was shown to trigger PKC signaling (Jesch et al, 2010)\nCells defective in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking such as the temperature sensitive sec13-1 mutant were shown to exhibit major changes in lipid metabolism upon shift to their restrictive temperature. Specifically, these cells exhibited a rapid decrease in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), while PI synthesis in wild type cells increased at higher temperatures. Simultaneously, sec13-1 cells increased synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAG) and other neutral lipids and accumulated lipid droplets upon shift to the restrictive temperature. Sec13-1 cells in which structural genes for the major TAG synthases were deleted exhibited decreases in their restrictive temperatures, indicating that synthesis of TAG under conditions in which ER to Golgi trafficking is impaired is physiologically relevant (Gaspar et al., 2008).\nMy role as Dean puts me in contact with constituents related to agriculture, community, and government.

{"name": "Tim Huffaker", "position": "Professor Emeritus, Molecular Biology and Genetics", "summary": "During every cell generation, chromosomes are replicated and sister chromosomes are segregated to each of the daughter cells. The segregation of chromosomes involves a complex cellular machine called the mitotic spindle. The major components of the mitotic spindle are microtubule fibers that connect chromosomes to the spindle poles, the poles to each other, and each pole to cellular components distal to the spindle. In addition, a large number of other proteins are involved in spindle function. Although many of these proteins are as yet uncharacterized, they are thought to include microtubule motor proteins that mediate movements, regulatory proteins that influence microtubule assembly, and structural proteins that are required for spindle assembly and function. These proteins work together to form an extremely efficient machine; in yeast, a chromosome is missegregated only once in every 100,000 cell divisions. The aim of our lab is to identify proteins involved in mitotic spindle function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to study the function of these proteins at the molecular level. With its sophisticated molecular genetics, increasingly powerful cell biology tools, and relatively simple mitotic spindle, yeast is a particularly tractable organism for these studies.", "courses_taught": [], "news_items": []},

{"name": "Mushahid Hussain", "position": "Ph.D. Candidate, Development Sociology, Department of Global Development", "summary": "Mushahid Hussain is a PhD candidate in development sociology at Cornell University. Trained in historical sociology and political economy, Hussain works within global/transnational and comparative-historical frameworks in exploring the past and contemporary politics of social change in Bangladesh and South Asia more broadly. Prior to pursuing a PhD, Hussain was a college lecturer in Bangladesh. He earned an MA in Sociology from the State University of New York at Binghamton, and also holds a master’s degree in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (New Delhi, India).\nHussain’s current research has three directions. His dissertation project, titled \n studies the politics of decolonization and state-making in erstwhile East Bengal/Pakistan (today Bangladesh). It explores how and why political demands for ethnolinguistic recognition and provincial autonomy, which arose in the two decades following the partition of British Bengal, were the outcomes of both long-term socio-historical processes and changing conjunctural conditions of the early Cold War in South Asia.\nHussain’s project is an interdisciplinary intervention in the following scholarly areas. First, it contributes to a rich historiography on decolonization and development in South Asia, exploring how and why political economic and cultural processes came to be grounded in the institutions, ideas, and practices that shaped the tensions of a global Cold War ‘from below.’ Second, his project’s approach to the politics and poetics of “nationalist time” develops a conjunctural approach to state formation and class politics. It is an ongoing, social-theoretic effort in differentiating the historical temporalities of the conjuncture, by way of addressing the \n relations between the ‘social’ and the ‘geopolitical’ that are often central to contemporary decolonial and connected/transnational/global approaches in historical sociology and related fields.\nThis work relies heavily on archives in Bangladesh and the US as well as published sources in English and Bengali, for illuminating the substantive connections between global philanthropy, international development agencies, and local institutions. Hussain received support from the \n and the \n for International Studies at Cornell for conducting this research, as well as early support from the Fernand Braudel Center at Binghamton University. His dissertation committee members are \n (Chair), \n, and \n.\nA second direction in Hussain’s current research is comparative urbanization in contexts of labor precarity, migration, and displacement. He is engaged in a collaborative project exploring the material and symbolic dimensions of urban practices like land brokering and urban rezoning in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and New York City (US), respectively. Hussain’s work in this area draws on contemporary syntheses of world-systems analysis, planetary urbanization, and the everyday politics of urban space-making. It relies on collaborative fieldwork and multi-sited ethnographies across localities within these city-regions.\nHussain is also interested in the social and political-philosophical aspects of knowledge production, specifically in the institutional contexts of the modern university. He has written on the socio-historical dimensions of higher education, and its institutional transformations in the global South following neoliberal globalization. He continues to research and write on these themes, exploring tensions between techno-politics, ‘new enclosures’, and universities as institutional spaces for critical reflection and decolonial praxis. Hussain’s work here is shaped by his abiding interests in classical theories of value and distribution, and debates regarding them in contemporary social and political thought.\nAs a lecturer in Bangladesh, Hussain designed and taught courses in environmental economics, international trade and development, and macroeconomics. As a graduate student in the US, he worked both as an instructor and/or teaching assistant on several courses, including introduction to sociology, feminism and globalization, labor and social movements, comparative social inequalities, theories of development, qualitative and mixed methods, and sociology of education. These experiences shape his interdisciplinary lenses on teaching and learning. They also inform his capacity as an educator in working with students from diverse backgrounds across different academic settings. \nFouad Makki (Chair)\nPhilip McMichael\nViranjini Munasinghe", "courses_taught": [], "news_items": []},

I selected Parthenium as a model species for my research because I am curious about the divergence and drivers of native, introduced, and invasive populations and how a changing climate could influence US populations. Parthenium also has an interesting story. The current native range of Parthenium is limited to the subtropical Americas and a few southern US states, but it is considered an invasive species in 50 countries worldwide that all started with contaminated grain exports from Texas and Mexico that introduced Parthenium into India and Australia in the 1950s. Characteristics aiding the extreme plasticity of Parthenium include drought avoidance, both cold and heat tolerance, and increased growth and allelopathic toxicity under elevated CO2 levels. I seek to understand how native populations (from Texas, US) and introduced and invasive populations (from Queensland, Australia, Tamil Nadu, India, Ramat-Yishay, Israel) respond to diverse climate-stress scenarios, in competition with C3 and C4 crops, and in a common garden experiment across the US. Additionally, I will use a CLIMEX model to determine the risk posed by Parthenium to US cropping systems under current and future climates. This research will inform risk assessments for Parthenium that can be implemented in US cropping systems and develop a framework to integrate knowledge about range shifts, phenotypic plasticity, and adaptive evolution in the context of climate change. \nLong term, I aim to be a part of a team of diverse, creative thinkers, to uncover the impact of climate change on weed demography and work towards agricultural climate adaptation solutions- whether that is with an accredited research university, ARS, or a global research institution.  \nWhen I’m not researching Parthenium, you can find me fly fishing in a trout stream, hiking, skiing, playing piano, or hanging out with my cat.", "courses_taught": [], "news_items": []},

My primary role is to provide effective leadership and take administrative responsibility for a team of researchers to enable them to conduct research/extension and develop educational packages via lectures, papers, fact sheets and multi-media to improve pesticide application in the State of New York and the North-East of the USA.The pesticide application technology group comprises a multi-disciplinary team of entomologists, plant pathologists, human ecologists and engineers. Within the engineering group I employ technicians, writers, illustrators, research associates and post doc. researchers.\nTo develop methods to improve deposition within the canopy and reduce off-target drift. Research includes the factors affecting airflow, speed and direction within the canopy. To develop new methods to apply pesticides precisely such as the use of GPS, GIS, RFID etc and improve traceability and management of sprayers.\nMy research group has filed for a patent on the adjustable airflow louvre via CTEC. We currently have 7 development sprayers working in NY and NJ orchards and vineyards.\nOur research thrust is on developing precision spraying techniques for horticultural crops. Notable milestones include a fully autonomous sprayer in citrus in Florida with colleagues at Carnegie Mellon and Univ. of Florida. We have developed a fully automatic sprayer controller for adjusting liquid and airflow on orchard and vineyard sprayers.\nAlternatives to spraying pesticides are also studied such as hot water/foam and mechanical methods. We also research engineering methods to reduce operator contamination and environmental pollution.\nOur research income is with collaborative grants with colleagues in other departments, universities and comes from a wide array of Federal, state and commodity groups, e.g EPA, SCRI, NY IPM, NY Wine and Grape Foundation, NY Apple Research and Development Fund.\nRecent activities include the development of a fixed sprayline system to address the Spotted Wing Drosophilla (SWD) outbreak in the NE USA.\nThe use of engineering methods to optimise pesticide use, improve deposition and reduce drift. To develop new methods to assist growers apply pesticides whilst reducing environmental pollution and operator contamination.\nTo show growers via field demonstrations, workshops and conference presentations how to monitor pesticide use, air direction and droplet penetration. An average of 45 presentations are made nationally and internationally each year.\nTo show growers novel and interesting methods of applying pesticides precisely. I wish to inspire growers to adopt new technology.\nTo improve the construction and use of existing crop sprayers.\nTo use interesting methods for teaching engineering science in an applied manner for farmers and growers.\nWorking in collaboration with Soil and Water conservation districts I have organised various Ag & Environmental grants for fruit growers:-\n1. 50% cost share for 10 orchard owners to buy sensor sprayers, Orleans Co.2006\n2. 50% cost share for 70 orchard and vineyard owners to buy sprayers/sprayer components to reduce environmental pollution in the Finger Lakes counties, Suffolk County, Long Island, NY and Yamhill Co., Oregon. 2011-2016\nThe use of engineering methods to optimize pesticide use on fruit and vegetables is the goal of my program at Cornell and I endeavour to transmit my enthusiasm for this goal to the students I teach. My focus is to illustrate good and poor practices to students, via a global view of application techniques via an interesting, challenging and exciting syllabus. I am one of a team of three teachers for the Grape Pest Management course at CU (PP/ENT/VIEN 3200), covering application technology.

{"name": "Brian Lazzaro", "position": "Professor, Department of Entomology", "summary": "Our research is focused on the evolutionary genomics of insect-pathogen interactions, emphasizing such questions as how natural selection operates on host immune systems and why individuals vary in susceptibility or resistance to infection. In my group, we like to think of the host as an assemblage of interacting physiological processes, where the immune system is embedded in the overall physiological context of the host. This motivates us to consider effects of abiotic environment on immune defense and means that genetic determination of variation in resistance may lie in genes outside of the canonical immune system. This thinking also extends directly to the evolution and mechanism of life history constraints. Importantly, the host is itself the \"environment\" in which an infecting pathogen lives, and differences in host physiological state or abiotic environment can alter microbial behavior and therefore ultimate outcomes of infection. Our overarching goal is to consider host and pathogen as interacting components of a single system, shaped by the environment. We primarily use bacterial infection in Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental model to deconstruct elements of the unified system, studying components in tractable modular pieces. Understanding the dynamics of unified host-pathogen-environment systems is crucial because these dynamics determine the ecology and evolution of disease in natural settings with consequence at higher biological scales.", "courses_taught": ["B.S., University of California, Davis", "Ph.D., Pennsylvania State University", "ENTOM 9900: Doctoral Level Thesis Research", "BIOG 4990: Independent Undergraduate Research in Biology", "Entom 4700 / BioEE 4800: Ecological Genetics"], "news_items": []},

In the 1990Õs, her lab initiated research on the molecular genetic analysis of the plant pathogenic phenotype in the genus Streptomyces species. These Gram-positive plant pathogens are economically important and possess novel mechanisms for manipulation of plant cells. Cloning of the highly conserved virulence gene nec1 led to the discovery of a large, mobile pathogenicity island (PAI). Mobilization of the PAI was demonstrated in a newly emerged pathogen, S. turgidiscabies. Characterization of the biosynthetic pathway for the phytotoxin, thaxtomin, led to the discovery that a niric oxide synthase is involved in nitration of this dipeptide. The 10 Mb S. scabies genome is now available and the lab is participating in genomic and proteomic analysis of pathogenicity, with several collaborators.

{"name": "Jason Mezey", "position": "Professor, Computational Biology", "summary": "Dr. Jason Mezey is a tenured faculty member in the Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology (Cornell University) and a statistical geneticist working in the area of quantitative genetics (i.e. the genetics of complex phenotypes). Dr. Mezey has spent the last decade developing cutting edge statistical and computational analysis methodology. Among other areas, this research has contributed to new methodology now applied to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), for identifying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and for network discovery. He also collaborates on the analysis of next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput data collected by researchers working on applied and basic problems in statistics, genomics, and medicine.\nMy research is driven by the question: How do we optimally apply computational statistics and machine learning to big biological data to produce actionable insights and predictions?  Our work on this question involves core research projects, management and analysis of big biological data, and development of new analysis methods and associated algorithms. Our core research projects fall within four major areas: (1) Genome Variation - where our published work includes papers on inferring relatedness, whole-genome analysis of human migration, and analysis of genome admixture, (2) Statistical Genetics - where our published work includes papers on association analysis of phenotypes ranging from molecular (including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and related), to complex diseases (including pedigree analysis, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and analysis of rare diseases), (3) Network Discovery - where our published work includes papers on causal modeling and network analysis of mixed genomic data types, (4) Disease Risk Prediction - where our published work includes papers on behavioral and environmental biomarkers, identification of disease subtypes, improvement of polygenic risk scores (PRS), and clinical predictors of cancer risk.  As a group, we are committed to providing a supportive and inclusive training environment for all members to perform original research and develop in-demand skills for their future careers.\nEvery year, I teach a four credit course in Quantitative Genomics and Genetics, which provides a rigorous treatment of analysis techniques used to understand complex genetic systems. This course covers both the fundamentals and advances in statistical methodology that are now used to analyze disease, agriculturally relevant, and evolutionarily important phenotypes. The course introduces the analysis of Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) data from first principles, as well as an intuition for how extensions of GWAS are applied in almost every genetic discipline. Application of classic inference and Bayesian analysis approaches are covered, with an emphasis on computational methods. Both a rigorous and intuitive understanding of concepts is emphasized throughout the course.", "courses_taught": ["Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University, 2000", "B.A. in Biology, University of Pennsylvania, 1994", "Genetics Pre-Doctoral Training Grant National Institutes of Health", "University Fellowship Yale University"], "news_items": []},

There are strong interconnections between animal feed contamination and human food chemical safety issues. With globalization of the food market and in anticipation of a future food crisis, food production with the help of food technologies are inevitable in order for ensure human food security. On the other hand, safety of chemical compounds found in food, whether it is unintentional (e.g. packaging migrants, by-product of processing, pesticide and drug residues) or intentional (e.g. food additives and even worse in adulteration), is a growing concern. My lab is specifically focused on study of endocrine disruptors found in food.\nEndocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) are found ubiquitously in food and the environment and can cause adverse health effects by interfering with the endocrine system. Exposures to EDCs are often chronic, occur at low concentrations, and the effects may be subtle but can have significant consequences. For example, there is emerging evidence that some EDCs could act as ‘obesogens’ by affecting adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Certain EDCs could also target critical stages of human and animal development. My laboratory is interested in how these EDCs that are ubiquitously detected in the environment and our diet, affect our health with particular focus on neurodevelopmental and reproductive functions. We use zebrafish to screen for toxic compounds in foods, beverages, and the environment and to understand underlining molecular mechanisms of endocrine disrupting effects of EDCs.\nI teach Food Chemistry Laboratory (FDSC 4190), Food Toxicology section of Current Readings in Food Science (FDSC6950-202) and will be developing a course in Food Toxicology.

She received both her B.S and M.S in Biology from the LIU Post Campus of Long Island University in 2009 and 2012 respectively. She then completed a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Structural Biology from Stony Brook University in 2018, and was an IRACDA NY-CAPS postdoctoral scholar with Dr. Jessica Seeliger at Stony Brook University. Her postdoc work focused on probing the functional relationship between cell envelope biogenesis and lipid export pathways in mycobacteria. Specifically, she worked to elucidate the role of the lipoprotein LprG in transporting lipids to the exterior layer of mycobacteria, known as the mycomembrane, which functions as a well armored, critical barrier that protects mycobacteria from various assaults such as antibiotics.\n \n \nThe Nisbett lab is interested in determining the mechanisms of pathogenesis of clinically significant yet critically understudied bacterial pathogens such as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).\nIn the clinic, NTM infections have become increasingly problematic as they are the primary cause of pulmonary lung infections, and are difficult to clear due to biofilm formation. As a result, there is a critical need for elucidating the mechanisms of NTM pathogenesis to develop novel therapeutics for NTM associated diseases. Using the model organism \n, and genetic, biochemical, and metabolite quantification-based approaches, our lab will broadly address this need by investigating what molecular mechanisms drive NTM biofilm formation. Our work will provide insight into whether these mechanisms could be utilized for future anti-bacterial applications against NTM infections.\n \n \n, Previti M.L., Seeliger J.C. 2023.

{"name": "Alison Power", "position": "Professor, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology", "summary": "My research program focuses on the ecology and epidemiology of plant pathogens transmitted by insects. There is increasing recognition that pathogens can have dramatic impacts on host populations and community structure and dynamics, but little is known about the ecology of plant viruses or other insect-transmitted pathogens. My research explores how plant community structure in both natural and agricultural ecosystems influences the epidemiology of insect-borne pathogens of plants. I have been particularly interested in understanding the role of vector movement in driving pathogen epidemiology, and I have examined how plant species diversity, host genetic diversity, and plant density and dispersion affect vector movement and disease spread. I have addressed these issues in disease systems in the northeast U.S., in Central America, and in Thailand. In recent years, I have used the aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf virus, a widespread pathogen of grasses, as a model system to address other aspects of the interactions between viruses, vectors and host plants. Projects have addressed the impact of virus infection on host plant preference of vector insects, direct and indirect competition between viruses, virus spread between crop hosts and wild host plants, the impacts of virus infection on wild grass hosts, and the ecological risks of transgenic virus resistance in crops. This work is intended to contribute to the design of environmentally benign agricultural systems, as well as to improve our understanding of disease ecology in natural plant communities.", "courses_taught": ["BIOG 4990: Independent Undergraduate Research in Biology", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 1610: Introductory Biology: Ecology and the Environment", "BIOEE 9990: Ph.D. Dissertation Research"], "news_items": []},

Ewan’s dissertation research contributes to debates about the trajectory of land tenure systems in African settings by shedding light on what he describes as “legibility politics.” These are the ubiquitous hybrid strategies used by land-claimants, who variously combine documents, ethical claims-making, ecological management, and digital practices to make land relations more or less visible, to construct property rights, and to pursue viable rural futures. Ewan has collaborated with Tanzanian land rights organizations and community groups to produce contextualized knowledge and to advocate for just rural development policies.\nEwan’s publications include work on the relationship between social difference and the emergence of environmental identities (\n), on the institutional drivers and limitations of food-based nutrition policies in global development (\n), and on the role of food markets in shaping nutrition outcomes (\n). He has also authored more than three dozen policy briefings, consultancy reports, and media pieces related to land tenure and agricultural, food, and nutrition policies and development (see \n).\nPrior to coming to Cornell, Ewan served as an applied policy researcher at the Institute of Development Studies, UK, where he conducted studies on food market dynamics, public and private regulatory institutions, and access to nutrition-enhancing foods among rural and urban residents in three African countries.

{"name": "John Sanderson", "position": "Associate Professor, Department of Entomology", "summary": "Because of intensive reliance on pesticide use for managing pests on greenhouse crops, arthropod resistance to pesticides has repeatedly left greenhouse growers with severe pest management challenges and few ready-to-use alternatives. Growers thus are actively seeking simple, cost-effective alternative solutions to pesticides. The Sanderson lab therefore seeks to develop integrated pest management tactics that are less likely to lead to resistance problems, emphasizing a biological control approach. Past research contributions for both the scientific community and eventually for growers have included studies on the biology, behavior, and applied ecology of all important greenhouse arthropod pests, as well as of a range of arthropod predators and parasitoids, as well as fungal pathogens of insects. Some studies have evaluated the integration of pesticides with natural enemies. Fundamental studies of arthropod biology and behavior are always encouraged, but usually with a view toward some aspect of solving pest management challenges.\nMy individual extension program provides up-to-date information on IPM of greenhouse arthropod pests of controlled environment agriculture crops to growers in NY and the nation. This is done via in-service activities for extension educators (labs, presentations, conference calls, and collaborating on applied research projects), responding to questions via email or phone, speaking at and preparing informational handouts for national, regional, and statewide grower programs, writing articles for newsletters and trade magazines, participating in webinars, and adding information to the Greenhouse Horticulture website. I also prepare the annual Cornell Guide For The Integrated Management Of Greenhouse Crops And Herbaceous Ornamentals. Collaborative extension programming with the NYS IPM Program Ornamentals Coordinator and specialists is a key part of my extension activities, as is participation in the Greenhouse Horticulture Program Work Team. Cornell faculty and staff who work on greenhouse crops are fortunate to have an active and supportive statewide Greenhouse Industry Advisory Board, who provides industry-based advice on our research and extension plans and ensures our connection to the needs of the industry. We conduct numerous regional hands-on workshops for growers, using microscopes and live plants and arthropod specimens, to train growers across the state on identification and biology of greenhouse pests and beneficials. Instruction on biological control implementation is always a part of these workshops. Funding for much extension programming has come from Smith-Lever funds or from New York Farm Viability Institute competitive grants.\nOutreach is very important in the Sanderson Lab. Insects are endlessly fascinating creatures! Enthusiasm for insects in the general public is often infectious, and we love to encourage that enthusiasm! My lab is very active at Insectapalooza (the annual Entomology Department open house), judging 4-H insect collections, giving talks about insects to Boy Scouts, home school groups, public school classes, church groups, and others.\nCoursework teaching responsibilities include Applied Entomology (ENTOM 3410), the introductory entomology course for entomology majors (Insect Biology ENTOM 2120) and for non-majors (Alien Empire ENTOM 2010/2011).

I have continued this focus at Cornell, with a specific interest in denitrification, the respiration of nitrogen oxides. My laboratory studies denitrification in related bacteria that occupy environmental niches ranging from the soil to the human body. We are interested in better understanding how these different bacteria adapt to environmental changes and deal with the stresses that arise from denitrification.

Impetus for nitrogen cycle studies have become more compelling in recent years with the recognition that human activities have more than doubled the annual global production of reactive nitrogen, resulting in considerable increases in the deposition of nitrogen onto ecosystems and the leaching of nitrogen from excess fertilizer use to ground- and drainage waters. Uncertainty about the fate of nitrate in ecosystems has led to increased interest in nitrogen transformations and gaseous losses via the microbial biogeochemistry of nitrogen but many drivers of nitrogen transformation remain poorly understood, regardless of scale. While nitrate is produced via microbial nitrification and consumed via microbial denitrification, the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, recent studies have shown that both processes are more dynamic and complicated than expected and the diversity of microorganisms playing prominent roles has been underestimated.\nDenitrification is the process by which the most problematic reactive nitrogen, nitrate, is converted to unreactive nitrogen gas. This conversion occurs in four reductive steps requiring four enzymes: nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductase, each reducing a separate product in the pathway .While excess nitrate can cause significant environmental problems, the ‘downstream’ products of denitrification are also environmentally important because of the roles they play in atmospheric chemistry. To better understand the factors that can impact the production and flux of these various nitrogen oxides it is essential to have a realistic model of the factors controlling denitrification. Our research is focused on studying denitrification at various scales to help provide information that will allow better understanding of the factors controlling flux through the denitrification pathway. We have used model organisms for many studies but have recently begun to use soil isolates to provide additional insight into the complexity of the denitrification landscape.\nMy teaching focuses on several aspects of bacteriology including physiology, genomics and structure/function aspects of bacterial cells. This will expand in the coming year to include a more general course in Public Health Microbiology.\nTeaching involves both introducing basic concepts to students but also providing students with the skills to gain knowledge through their own activities. This latter is critical for making students lifelong learners. In every course I teach I make an effort to make learning as active as possible. These efforts have ranged from helping guide freshman analyze and compare bacterial genomes to working with seniors to construct pathway flowcharts from a variety of web based sources. I will continue to utilize new approaches and techniques to aid in this effort to have students actively involved in learning new material.", "courses_taught": ["DoctorateUniversity of Georgia1987", "Bachelor of ScienceClemson University1977", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOG 1440: Introductory Biology: Comparative Physiology", "BIOMI 2500: Public Health Microbiology"], "news_items": []},

I joined Cornell at the Geneva Experiment Station in 1990 as a Full Professor. I served as Chair of the Food Science & Technology Dept. for the first five years (two terms). Since then I have mainly been engaged in research with some teaching and extension; my current effort distribution officially includes research, teaching and extension. I teach the brewing part of FD SC 4300 (Understanding Wine and Beer) each spring and I teach FD SC 6080 (Chemometric Methods in Food Science) in the Fall of alternate years.\nIn terms of disciplines, my program is spread across food chemistry, food microbiology and sensory analysis and it is largely tied together with chemometrics (the application of multivariate math and statistics). The focus of the chemistry part of the program is largely on the manner in which macromolecules interact with small molecules to produce phenomena that people can directly perceive. This includes interactions of proline-rich proteins with polyphenols that produce visible turbidity in beverages and astringency in the mouth, interactions of proteins with hop bitter compounds that are involved in beer foam and gushing (uncontrolled overfoaming upon opening a container), and binding of flavor compounds by proteins and other macromolecules. I am also interested in how the molecular properties of organic compounds determine their flavor intensity (perception thresholds) and how the amino acid composition of proteins determines their physicochemical and functional properties. In the microbiology area I am interested in a number of mathematical approaches to microbiological problems. This has included work in simulation modeling of the microbial sampling of liquids, modeling how the molecular properties of organic acids result in different degrees of inhibition of different species of bacteria, and the use of pattern recognition approaches for characterizing and identifying bacteria. In the sensory area, in addition to several previously mentioned items, my group has pioneered the use of proper sensory tests (for determining perception thresholds, estimating haze intensity and describing appearance) to observe the effects of sample properties (solution color and particle size and concentration) and viewing conditions (illumination intensity and background contrast) on human visual response to turbidity. In terms of commodities my program is concentrated in beverage technology, particularly brewing, but also including fruit juice, wine, tea and coffee. Work has included fundamental studies of particle formation in beverages, mechanisms of action of various haze stabilization approaches and analytical approaches to measuring haze-active constituents.\nI am responsible for Cornell's brewing extension program. I present extension workshops and short courses on brewing topics. Occasionally I respond to contacts from media or correspond with media on brewing or beverage related topics. Beer brewing and brewing science.\nI make presentations on producing alcohol from grains in distillation workshops.\nI train and advise students/faculty members from my department, and occasionally those from other departments, on statistical experiment design and chemometrics/ multivariate data analysis. I respond to information requests from industry in NY and beyond.\nI teach the brewing part of the course FDSC4300 Understanding Wine and Beer each spring.\nI teach the graduate course FDSC6080 Chemometrics in Food Science in alternate years in the fall semester.

Stanton is the primary organizer of the Cornell Goat Program which is outlined below. She also helped develop and co-chairs the New York Small Farm Livestock Processing Issues Work Team funded and supported by the Cornell Small Farms Program. The work team provides resources on marketing and processing livestock. The team also works with regulatory groups (NYSDAM and USDA FSIS), farmers and processors to educate people about regulatory policies involving livestock processing and marketing and, when applicable, participates in discussions to interpret and/or modify regulations.\nGoats are an important part of New York agriculture. New York ranks fifth in the nation for dairy goat numbers. Our goat dairies provide an active cottage industry to meet the strong demand for gourmet goat cheeses and dairy products in New York City and other urban centers. The demand for goat meat is also centered in the Northeast U.S where more than half the goats in the United States are slaughtered. Small ruminants such as goats and sheep are very important to the preservation of green space in New York.\nThe Cornell Goat Program interacts with a diverse group of goat enthusiasts from hobbyists to commercial producers and from youth to adults. It is a part-time program funded primarily through grants. Activities vary depending upon funding and issues that seem most critical for goat farmers. In 2004 much of the time was spent helping farmers with marketing projects and completing a website at http://www.sheepgoatmarketing.info that includes a searchable directory of lamb and goat buyers and processors, later hosted by the University of Maryland extension program due to funding constraints. Funding for our goat program from 2005 to 2008 was primarily through a NESARE Research and Extension Grant to improve the viability of meat goat farms by:\nOur observations based 56 on-farm studies centered on creep feeding, dewormer resistance, flushing, out of season breeding, and pasture management to reduce worm loads. Although the numerous participating farms increased their knowledge base, the fact sheets for four topics became available only recently. Results from the study on pasture management to reduce worm loads were incorporated into a series of workshops on integrated parasite and pasture management. Herd profile summaries indicated that farms are adopting the beneficial practices identified in this study and are also more successful at out of season breeding than they were at the initiation of the project.\nIn December 2008 we started working on a 3 year long program looking at methods to reduce labor, feed and financial inputs at kidding and lambing without sacrificing animal health and productivity.\nThe Cornell Goat Program works directly with both adults and youth because most goat farms tend to be family run operations. Our primary goat outreach events are the Cornell Sheep & Goat Symposium and Caprine Outing, a 3-day workshop series geared towards families, 4-H groups and commercial producers. The family formatted event gets excellent evaluations. \n. In addition, the Cornell Goat Program is responsible for coordinating youth goat activities at the New York State Fair with assistance from Dr. Tro Bui and the Cornell Youth Goat Advisory Committee.\nDr. Tatiana Stanton also helps moderate several list-servers for farmers and processors hosted by the Cornell Goat and Sheep Programs, including two well established list-servers: small ruminant marketing (\n, 320 subscribers), and livestock processing issues (\n, 255 subscribers).", "courses_taught": ["DoctorateCornell University - 1990", "Texas A&M University - 1986", "Master of ScienceCal Poly State University - 1980", "Bachelor of ScienceCal Poly State University - 1976", "2017 Person of the Year (2017) NYS Dairy Goat Breeders Association", "Outstanding Accomplishments in Ext.

{"name": "Stephen Winans", "position": "Professor, Microbiology", "summary": "I earned my PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984 studying conjugative drug resistance plasmids, and did post-doctoral work at the University of Washington studying Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes tumors on host plants.  I joined the department in 1988, continuing both areas of research.  My main teaching responsibilities are one course on the molecular mechanisms of bacterial and viral pathogenesis of humans, and another course about the origin of life.\nI have been a member of the Department of Microbiology since 1988. I obtained his PhD degree in Biology at M.I.T., working with Graham Walker, and did postdoctoral studies at the University of Washington with Eugene Nester. As a postdoctoral fellow, I helped describe how the plant pathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens detects chemical cues that are released from plant wound sites, and uses this information to transcribe genes that direct the disease process. The detection of these signals requires one of the first-described two-component regulatory systems, composed of a sensory histidine kinase and a phosphorylated response regulator. I have continued with these studies at Cornell University.\nSince joining the Cornell faculty, our lab has used Agrobacterium to continue studies of chemical ecology. We have elucidated how Agrobacterium detects a variety of plant-released chemical cues. Beginning in the early 1990’s, our lab broadened its focus to study how this bacterium can detect chemical signals released by sibling bacteria. Thanks in part to his work, we now know that many bacteria use diffusible molecules as pheromones to estimate their population density and to coordinate their physiologies. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as quorum sensing, a term that we coined in a review article. Quorum sensing in Agrobacterium requires TraI and TraR proteins, where TraI synthesizes the pheromone in this system, while TraR is a pheromone receptor and pheromone-dependent transcription factor. Our group was the first to purify any protein in the TraI family and reconstitute its pheromone synthesis activities in a purified system.\nWe then turned our attention to the pheromone receptor protein TraR. We did the first purification of any member of the TraR family and reconstituted all of its properties in a purified system. One interesting discovery was that TraR cannot fold into a soluble, functional form in the absence of its pheromone, indicating that the pheromone acts as a scaffold for protein folding. The same was later shown to be general property of most of these proteins. We also collaborated in obtaining the high-resolution crystal structure of TraR-pheromone-DNA complexes. A decade later, no other member of this family has been crystallized in such a ternary complex.\nWe also study the quorum-sensing systems of two other bacteria, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and of Yersinia enterocolitica, both human pathogens. The CepR and CepI proteins of B. cenocepacia follow the same general patterns as the TraR and TraI proteins, in that CepI makes a pheromone that CepR needs for activity. However, this organism also expresses a protein called CepR2, which resembles CepR, and which detects the pheromone made by CepI. However, CepR2 is active only in the absence of this pheromone.\nThe YenI and YenR proteins of Y. enterocolitica also have some surprising properties. Like CepR2, YenR is active only in the absence of the pheromone make by YenI. YenR activates the transcription of a small noncoding RNA called YenS. YenS stimulates the swarming motility of the organism across an agar surface. YenS is opposed by another small RNA called YenT. Y. enterocolitica also encodes another pheromone receptor called YetR, whose functions remain to be described.\nIn the course of these studies, my lab has published 98 original research articles, 15 review articles, and 12 book chapters. I have edited two books, both on the topic of cell-cell signaling in bacteria. One book was co-edited by Dr. Gary Dunny (University of Minnesota) while the other was co-edited by Bonnie Bassler (Princeton University). I have also organized two ASM conferences that focused on cell-cell communication. I am a member of the American Academy for Microbiology, and have served on several funding panels for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\nI have three main teaching responsibilities. I teach half of our General Microbiology Lectures (BIOMI 2900), including the central dogma, gene regulation, mutations, and pathogenic microbiology. I teach 100% of Microbiology of Human Contagious Disease (BIOMI 2600). I also teach a graduate level course in bacterial pathogenesis, with an emphasis on critical reading of primary literature.", "courses_taught": ["Outstanding Accomplishments in Basic Research Award (2014) CALS, Cornell University", "Fellow 2003 American Academy of Microbiology", "BIOMI 1200: Genesis", "BIOG 4990: Independent Undergraduate Research in Biology", "BIOMI 2600: Microbiology of Human Contagious Diseases"], "news_items": []},

Specifically, I am interested in the links between traits or attributes of organisms (such as philopatry, sexual selection, unequal migration between the sexes, and reproductive skew) and the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity among populations or species. The mechanisms underlying population, lineage or species differentiation are central to the origin of biological diversityÑ these are, in essence, what evolution is all about. Nonetheless, most studies of differentiation are either genetic studies of population structure or single-population studies of species-specific attributes (such as mating behavior, reproductive skew, or migration). There are compelling reasons we should combine these approaches; if we examine population differentiation in an integrated fashion we can disentangle the role and relative magnitude of various microevolutionary forces underlying differentiation, the extent to which species-specific characteristics mediate this process, and the degree to which population-level processes or mechanisms translate to patterns of differentiation at larger scales. The main goal of my research program is to integrate these analytical approaches and test hypotheses about the patterns and processes of differentiation at various geographical and evolutionary scales.", "courses_taught": ["BIOEE 1781: Introduction to Evolution and Diversity", "BIOEE 9990: Ph.D. Dissertation Research", "BIOEE 9990: Ph.D. Dissertation Research", "BIOEE 9990: Ph.D. Dissertation Research"], "news_items": []},

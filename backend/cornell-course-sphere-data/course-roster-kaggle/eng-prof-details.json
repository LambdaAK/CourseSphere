{"prof_name": "Geoffrey Abers", "bio": "Geoff Abers is a geophysicist who uses the tools of earthquake seismology to understand the forces, material cycles, and deep structure of the Earth. He uses modern seismic instrument arrays onshore and offshore to image high-resolution structures in the crust and mantle, and uses those images to understand the material and fluid cycles of the planet. He received his Sc.B. from Brown University in 1983, his Ph.D. from MIT in 1989, and has had research or faculty positions at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, the University of Kansas, and Boston University. He joined the Cornell faculty in 2014. He is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the Geological Society of America, and a member of the Seismological Society of America. He is project lead for the Alaska Amphibious Community Seismic Experiment, a former Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, and former chair of the US MARGINS program. Geoff is currently the Chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. Abers has a primary interest in understanding processes that drive deformation and material cycling within the earth, mostly at active plate boundaries. Subduction zones have been a main interest, the sites of the planet's largest earthquakes, most devastating volcanic eruptions, and the places where the growth of continental crust takes place. Many of his major projects have been deployments of dense arrays of broadband seismographs to image structure in places such as Alaska, Central America, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Northwest. These dense arrays allow unprecedented imaging of features as small as layering within subducted crust to beyond 100 km depth, and provide insight into the manner in which high-pressure metamorphism takes place, the deep plumbing beneath arc volcanoes, and the nature of the megathrust faults that host magnitude 9 earthquakes. Active projects around Mt St Helens, Washington and along the Alaska margin address these projects. In addition, he has applied many of the methods of analyzing earthquake source properties and their relationship to fluid generation both to understand intermediate-depth earthquakes within subducting plates, and to understand crustal earthquakes potentially induced by anthropogenic activities.", "research_interests": [{"text": "Earth and Atmospheric Science", "link": "/earth-and-atmospheric-science"}, {"text": "Energy and the Environment", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/energy-and-environment"}, {"text": "Energy Systems", "link": "/energy-systems"}, {"text": "Sustainable Energy Systems", "link": "/sustainable-energy-systems"}, {"text": "Earth System Science", "link": "/earth-system-science"}, {"text": "Energy, Mineral and Water Resources", "link": "/energy-mineral-and-water-resources"}, {"text": "Tectonics and Structural Geology", "link": "/tectonics-and-structural-geology"}, {"text": "Geochemistry, Petrology and Volcanology", "link": "/geochemistry-petrology-and-volcanology"}, {"text": "Ocean Sciences", "link": "/ocean-sciences"}, {"text": "Geophysics and Seismology", "link": "/geophysics-and-seismology"}, {"text": "Natural Hazards", "link": "/natural-hazards"}, {"text": "Geophysical Fluid Dynamics", "link": "/geophysical-fluid-dynamics"}, "Abers has a primary interest in understanding processes that drive deformation and material cycling within the earth, mostly at active plate boundaries.

Hunter spent his first two years at Cornell working in the Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics and running varsity cross country/track and field. He joined Mason Peck's spacecraft research group at the beginning of his second year and discovered a passion for engineering. That passion led him to manage a team of engineers constructing a spacecraft called Violet, work for a short time at SpaceX, and, ultimately, to start his Ph.D. with Mason. He both finished his degree in physics and started his PhD in engineering in 2015. Hunter's Ph.D. was almost entirely devoted to hardware—specifically to building small spacecraft and the infrastructure for communicating with them. He also worked extensively on estimation problems, navigation, and on-orbit routing mechanisms. Hunter is curious about a lot of topics. His curiosity led to collaborations with researchers in plant sciences, veterinary science, electrical engineering, ornithology, and computer science. He looks forward to a career spent building things, teaching, and indulging interdisciplinary curiosities.

{"prof_name": "Steven Graham Adie", "bio": "Dr. Adie joined Cornell University in 2013 after a postdoc at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His postdoctoral research in optical coherence tomography (OCT) had a few main themes: computational image formation to optimize resolution in volumetric OCT, dynamic optical coherence elastography (OCE) to generate images based on the mechanical properties of tissue, and translational OCT research for image-guided surgery in breast cancer. He earned his Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from The University of Western Australia. Dr. Adie also worked for several years in the R&D division of a startup company that developed solid-state laser systems for LASIK eye surgery. Dr. Adie's research program focuses on the development and application of OCT-based imaging for basic science investigations as well as clinical applications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality capable of 3D label-free imaging of tissue structure and function in vivo. It can be thought of as the optical analogue of ultrasound, although the measurement of 'optical echoes' supports much higher resolution. OCT-based instrumentation and imaging techniques are being developed in the Adie Lab to optimize resolution and enhance the contrast of 3D-OCT. This includes methods for optical coherence elastography (OCE) to image the mechanical properties of tissues. OCE provides a high-resolution 'palpation' capability by mechanically perturbing a sample and precisely imaging the corresponding displacements. We also explore new image formation paradigms for cellular-resolution volumetric OCT. These efforts exploit computational approaches that are made possible by recognizing that OCT combines the advantages of digital holography with the beam-scanning benefits afforded by confocal microscopy. \nBasic science: While much OCT research has focused on clinical applications, the role of OCT in the basic sciences is less developed. This part of the research program aims to exploit the advantages of OCT-based imaging of tissue structure and function to better understand the development and progression of disease. Of particular interest is the application of OCE to study the role of mechanical properties in carcinogenesis. These investigations benefit from multidisciplinary collaborations both within the department and with other researchers at Cornell. \nClinical applications: The label-free non-invasive imaging capabilities of OCT allow for the instrumentation development and basic science research mentioned above to be translated 'from the bench to the bedside'. This involves the design, construction and deployment of portable systems, as well as the studies to test the sensitivity and specificity of image-based biomarkers for disease diagnosis, or for monitoring response to treatment.", "research_interests": [{"text": "Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation", "link": "/biomedical-imaging-and-instrumentation"}, {"text": "Biomedical Engineering", "link": "/biomedical-engineering"}, {"text": "Bioengineering", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/bioengineering"}, {"text": "Biomechanics and Mechanobiology", "link": "/biomechanics-and-mechanobiology"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "Leartprapun N., Iyer R.R., Untracht G.R., Mulligan J.A. and Adie S.G., “ Photonic force optical coherence elastography for three-dimensional mechanical microscopy ”,  Nature Communications , 9:2079, 2018.", "hyperlink": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04357-8"}, {"text": "Mulligan J.A., François B., Reinhart-King C.A., and Adie S.G. 2017. “ Measurement of dynamic cell-induced 3D displacement fields in vitro for traction force optical coherence microscopy” ,  Biomedical Optics Express , 8 (2): 1152-1171.", "hyperlink": "https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-8-2-1152"}, {"text": "Shemonski, N D., F A.

Rawlings III Professor of Paleontology in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. He earned his A.B. in Earth Sciences from Dartmouth College in 1982, and his Ph.D. in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Harvard University in 1988. For four years he was Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of South Florida, Tampa, and became PRI's fourth Director in 1992. Since 1992, he has been instrumental in rejuvenating PRI's internationally-known fossil collections; starting its local, regional, and national programs in Earth science education; and in planning and fundraising for the Museum of the Earth, PRI's $11 million education and exhibit facility which opened in September 2003. In November 2004, Allmon helped secure a formal agreement of affiliation between PRI and Cornell, ending more than 70 years of official separation. \nAllmon's major research interest is macroevolution and paleoecology, especially the ecology of the origin and maintenance of biological diversity and the application of the geological record to the study of these problems, particularly using Cenozoic marine gastropods (snails of the last 65 million years). \nAllmon is the author of more than 250 technical and popular publications. He is a Fellow of the Geological Society of America and the Paleontological Society, and the recipient of the 2004 Award for Outstanding Contribution to Public Understanding of Geoscience from the American Geological Institute.

{"prof_name": "James Francis Antaki", "bio": "  The majority of Prof. Antaki's professional career has been devoted to development of blood-wetted medical devices. His research focuses on the methodology by which these devices are designed and used clinically. His group was one of the pioneers in physiological feedback control of implanted ventricular assist devices, and also developed one of the first decision support programs for identifying heart failure patients who could potentially recover with the acute mechanical circulatory assistance. Over the past 24 years, Antaki has contributed to the development of several heart-assist devices used clinically, including the Heartmate-II, Novacor, Ventracor, TandemHeart, and Levacor. In 1997, he directed a multidisciplinary team that produced the Streamliner heart-assist device - the world's first magnetically levitated rotodynamic blood pump to be tested in-vivo. The current emphasis of Prof. Antaki's research involves five application areas: circulatory support systems for children, decision-support tools for severe heart failure, diagnostic technology for the home and point-of-care to improve patient engagement, multi-scale modeling of thrombosis in artificial circulation, and development of medical devices for global health. A nascent, overarching project aims to accelerate medical innovation by professional networking between physicians, medical product designers, and patients. Although these interests and experiences are diverse, they share a common theme of improving healthcare though biomedical engineering.     Meinig School M.Eng. students Ivan Jiran, Stephen Chupil, and Liam McLane describe their yearlong design project working with professor Antaki to develop a robust and low-cost mock circulatory loop (MCL) to facilitate lab testing of pediatric left ventricular assist devices (LVADs).", "research_interests": [{"text": "Biomedical Engineering", "link": "/biomedical-engineering"}, {"text": "Bioengineering", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/bioengineering"}, {"text": "Biomechanics and Mechanobiology", "link": "/biomechanics-and-mechanobiology"}, {"text": "Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation", "link": "/biomedical-imaging-and-instrumentation"}, {"text": "Systems and Synthetic Biology", "link": "/systems-and-synthetic-biology"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "Rowlands GW, Pagani FD, Antaki JF.

{"prof_name": "Susan Daniel", "bio": "Susan Daniel is the Director of the Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University. She leads a research group of biomolecular engineers working to understand cell membrane functions and the biological processes that happen within them. Her group pioneered the use of “cell-free” biomembrane platforms for re-creating cellular processes on chip. Much of the work they do has impact in human health or advancing biotechnologies for the good of humankind. For example, her group examines the interactions of biological “pathogenic” nanoparticles, including viruses, bacterial outer membrane vesicles, and oncogenic extracellular vesicles, with cell membrane surfaces. This work has elucidated how these interactions lead to specific biological outcomes like virus infection and disease, biofilm development, and new tissue growth. Her group’s recent work leverages biomembrane chips for synthetic cellular biomanufacturing in “organelles-on-a-chip” to produce therapeutic biomolecules.  And more recently, her group has embarked on studies of plant cell membranes, motivated by the impact of climate change on the ability of plants to adapt. Susan has published her work in top journals including  ,  , and  . Susan and her group’s research has garnered a number of scientific recognitions. She is the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2011, the Schwartz Life Sciences award in 2016, and in 2017, Susan was honored with the College of Engineering’s Research Excellence Award. Four of her current students received National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships, several have been honored with prestigious Sloan Fellowships, and others have been selected to participate in esteemed NIH-funded training grants. Susan believes that greater access to education for all people leads to more diverse perspectives and greater creativity, which are essential to pursue her research topics. She is committed to the promotion of inclusive and empowering environments in all aspects of education, but especially the STEM fields. Susan has served as the Director of Graduate Studies in her department from 2016-2019. During her tenure in that role she developed and implemented new recruiting practices for graduate students, taking the bold position that she could meet demographic parity and still maintain graduate student quality. These practices have translated to the most diverse classes CBE has had in its history with high water marks of 65% women in the 2019 entering PhD class and 40% underrepresented students in the 2018 entering PhD class, both marks well above the national average. 2018 also brought students from 10 countries. Susan has served as the faculty advisor for the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Graduate Women’s Group (CBE Women) from 2008-2020. This group provides professional development and leadership opportunities to graduate students to complement their technical graduate education. In 2018, she founded a Diversity and Inclusion Program within her department to educate and inform members about inclusive practices and to build an enriching environment for all - from the classroom to the lab - to help all students succeed and reach their potential. Susan has been honored for her commitment to increasing access to education for all students with the Denice Denton Emerging Leader Award in 2012, the Zellman Warhaft Commitment to Diversity Award in 2014, the Alice H. Cook award in 2015. She was also selected to the shortlist of the 2016 international GEDC Airbus Diversity Award for her work advising the outreach program, (called WOMEN), for 10th grade girls and their families from rural upstate communities. Susan serves as the faculty-in-residence for Balch Hall: the all-women, freshmen residence hall. In this role she provides educational programming and intellectual engagement activities for a hall of 445 women. Among her favorite offerings is a “Learning Where You Live” course she teaches on women’s leadership and empowerment. Balch Hall counts Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg among its alumnae and Susan considers it an honor to lead Balch now and positively influence today’s young women to set their sights high and aspire to impactful life pursuits, perhaps inspiring tomorrow’s Supreme Court justice, leading tech entrepreneur, or president! Susan holds a BS, MS and PhD from Lehigh University and conducted her post-doctoral work at Texas A&M University in the Department of Chemistry. She considers it an honor to share authorship with Nobel Laureate Professor Pierre de Gennes on one of her early publications in graduate school, which set her onto the pathway of becoming an academic professor. In Susan’s free time she enjoys getting back to nature and hiking. She has completed 200 miles of GR5 trail through the French Alps, has hiked through the wilds of Montana and seen grizzly bear and moose at close range, and enjoys climbing the mountains of the high peak area in the Adirondack Park in her home state of New York. ", "research_interests": [{"text": "Colloids and Interfacial Science", "link": "/colloids-and-interfacial-science"}, {"text": "Molecular Biotechnology", "link": "/molecular-biotechnology"}, {"text": "Fluid Dynamics and Rheology", "link": "/fluid-dynamics-and-rheology"}, {"text": "Polymers and Soft Matter", "link": "/polymers-and-soft-matter"}, {"text": "Nanobio Applications", "link": "/nanobio-applications"}, {"text": "Biomedical Engineering", "link": "/biomedical-engineering"}, {"text": "Bioengineering", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/bioengineering"}, {"text": "Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation", "link": "/biomedical-imaging-and-instrumentation"}, {"text": "Microfluidics", "link": "/microfluidics"}, {"text": "Molecular and Cellular Engineering", "link": "/molecular-and-cellular-engineering"}, {"text": "Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine", "link": "/drug-delivery-and-nanomedicine"}, {"text": "Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials", "link": "/tissue-engineering-biomaterials"}, {"text": "Biomolecular Engineering", "link": "/biomolecular-engineering"}, {"text": "COVID-19 Related Research", "link": "/covid-19-related-research"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "  Liu, H.Y., Pappa, A.M., Pavia, A., Pitsalidis, C., Thiburce, Q., Salleo, A., Owens, R.M.* and S.

DeLisa joined the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Cornell University as an assistant professor in 2003. He was promoted to associate professor in 2009 and to professor in 2013, at which time he was named the William L. Lewis Professor of Engineering. He also recently served as a Gastprofessur at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich) in the Institut für Mikrobiologie. \nProfessor DeLisa's research focuses on understanding and controlling the molecular mechanisms underlying protein biogenesis -- folding and assembly, membrane translocation and post-translational modifications -- in the complex environment of a living cell. His contributions to science and engineering include the invention of numerous commercially important technologies for facilitating the discovery, design and manufacturing of human drugs and seminal discoveries in the areas of cellular protein folding and protein translocation. DeLisa has received several awards for his work including an NSF CAREER award (2005), a NYSTAR Watson Young Investigator award (2004), a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator award (2005), an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator award (2006), and a NYSTAR Distinguished Faculty Award (2007), the inaugural Wiley-Blackwell Biotechnology and Bioengineering Daniel I.C.

{"prof_name": "Chloé Arson", "bio": "Dr. Chloé Arson is a Professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at Cornell University and an adjunct faculty in the Schools of CEE and Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). She earned her Ph.D. at Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées (France) in 2009. She was an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University from 2009 to 2012. Then, she worked as an Assistant Professor (2012-2016), Associate Professor (2016-2022) and Professor (2022-2023) in the Georgia Tech School of CEE. Dr. Arson joined the faculty at Cornell University in Summer 2023.  Dr. Arson’s expertise is damage and healing rock mechanics, micro-macro modeling of porous media, and computational geomechanics. Her group develops numerical tools to assess the performance and environmental impacts of underground storage and rock fracturing, explain the formation of soil by rock weathering, and design sustainable bio-inspired geotechnical systems. Lately, Arson started investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize subsurface exploration and enhance multi-scale geomechanical models. Understanding the mechanisms that trigger fragmentation in granular media and cemented aggregates is of primary importance for optimizing the stability of earth structures, designing ballast and processing food. Arson’s group uses the Discrete Element Method to simulate particulate flow and aggregate particle crushing. Damage and healing rock mechanics is important to design safe underground storage facilities, assess the impact of hydraulic fracturing, understand fault dynamics, and simulate geomorphological processes. Arson’s group developed original thermodynamic and micromechanical models of crack initiation, opening, closure and rebonding for carbonate rock, granite, and halite, which are common geological host materials. The lab now uses AI to detect the microstructure features that are the most important to capture rock behavior at the macro-scale. Landscapes encode the history of the climate. For example, saprolite, the intermediate material between rock and soil, plays a critical role in the evolution of topography, nutrient supply, landslide hazards, and the global carbon cycle. The subsurface also bears resources used for the production of energy and construction materials. It is thus important to assess the response of soils, rocks and other geomaterials to a varying climate and to increasing societal demands. Arson’s group implemented a micro-macro model of anisotropic damage upon time-dependent biotite expansion in the Finite Element Method (FEM) to understand the impact of bedrock weathering on mechanical damage in typical landscapes. The lab is also working on the forecast of greenhouse gas emissions from sediments subjected to hydraulic forcings. Predicting the occurrence of large-scale fractures (0.1m-10m) as the result of the interaction and/or coalescence of microscopic cracks is important to predict many instabilities in geomechanics. To this end, Arson’s group developed computational tools to simulate the propagation of a discrete fracture within a continuum damage process zone, both with Cohesive Zone models and the eXtended Finite Element Method. Simulation results highlighted the influence of intrinsic anisotropy on fluid-driven fracture propagation, which is of significance for deep geothermal energy extraction and cavern stability. The lab also simulated time-dependent damage propagation and healing of salt rock at the vicinity of geological storage facilities. Dr. Arson is currently leading a research effort that aims to develop a self-propelled Burrowing Robot with an Integrated Sensor System (BRISS). Arson’s group assessed the performance of compound anchors with a novel method that combines the FEM with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Her lab also analyzed the deformation and failure mechanisms induced by the pressurization of a cylindrical body at shallow depth, which bridged an important knowledge gap, since no analytical solution accounts for the geostatic gradient. Because of the lack of closed-form solutions, it is challenging to predict in situ stresses to back-calculate soil properties from data collected by embarked sensors. That is why Arson’s group has trained and tested neural networks that can estimate mechanical properties of a granular soil from the stress field at the soil/robot interface. Arson’s group is also developing bio-inspiration strategies to minimize the energy and power needed to explore underground and construct durable tunnel systems in which to deploy monitoring systems. Arson’s lab has modeled biological dynamic networks to increase the adaptability of infrastructure. It was found that the cost and performance of a leaf venation network are comparable to those of a spanning tree but an order of magnitude faster, which suggests that rapid leaf inspired solutions could be used to initialize more optimal spanning tree algorithms. Arson’s group studied the mechanisms of plant root growth in natural soil and the response of root architectures to obstacles to seek biomimetic solutions to demands for infrastructure network adaptation. The research team also designed image analysis tools to assess network resilience in slime mold, a protist, amoeba-like organism that grows by foraging.

Lately, Arson started investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize subsurface exploration and enhance multi-scale geomechanical models.", "Understanding the mechanisms that trigger fragmentation in granular media and cemented aggregates is of primary importance for optimizing the stability of earth structures, designing ballast and processing food. Arson’s group uses the Discrete Element Method to simulate particulate flow and aggregate particle crushing.", "Damage and healing rock mechanics is important to design safe underground storage facilities, assess the impact of hydraulic fracturing, understand fault dynamics, and simulate geomorphological processes. Arson’s group developed original thermodynamic and micromechanical models of crack initiation, opening, closure and rebonding for carbonate rock, granite, and halite, which are common geological host materials. The lab now uses AI to detect the microstructure features that are the most important to capture rock behavior at the macro-scale.", "Landscapes encode the history of the climate. For example, saprolite, the intermediate material between rock and soil, plays a critical role in the evolution of topography, nutrient supply, landslide hazards, and the global carbon cycle. The subsurface also bears resources used for the production of energy and construction materials. It is thus important to assess the response of soils, rocks and other geomaterials to a varying climate and to increasing societal demands. Arson’s group implemented a micro-macro model of anisotropic damage upon time-dependent biotite expansion in the Finite Element Method (FEM) to understand the impact of bedrock weathering on mechanical damage in typical landscapes. The lab is also working on the forecast of greenhouse gas emissions from sediments subjected to hydraulic forcings.", "Predicting the occurrence of large-scale fractures (0.1m-10m) as the result of the interaction and/or coalescence of microscopic cracks is important to predict many instabilities in geomechanics. To this end, Arson’s group developed computational tools to simulate the propagation of a discrete fracture within a continuum damage process zone, both with Cohesive Zone models and the eXtended Finite Element Method. Simulation results highlighted the influence of intrinsic anisotropy on fluid-driven fracture propagation, which is of significance for deep geothermal energy extraction and cavern stability. The lab also simulated time-dependent damage propagation and healing of salt rock at the vicinity of geological storage facilities.", "Dr. Arson is currently leading a research effort that aims to develop a self-propelled Burrowing Robot with an Integrated Sensor System (BRISS). Arson’s group assessed the performance of compound anchors with a novel method that combines the FEM with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Her lab also analyzed the deformation and failure mechanisms induced by the pressurization of a cylindrical body at shallow depth, which bridged an important knowledge gap, since no analytical solution accounts for the geostatic gradient. Because of the lack of closed-form solutions, it is challenging to predict in situ stresses to back-calculate soil properties from data collected by embarked sensors. That is why Arson’s group has trained and tested neural networks that can estimate mechanical properties of a granular soil from the stress field at the soil/robot interface. Arson’s group is also developing bio-inspiration strategies to minimize the energy and power needed to explore underground and construct durable tunnel systems in which to deploy monitoring systems.", "Arson’s lab has modeled biological dynamic networks to increase the adaptability of infrastructure. It was found that the cost and performance of a leaf venation network are comparable to those of a spanning tree but an order of magnitude faster, which suggests that rapid leaf inspired solutions could be used to initialize more optimal spanning tree algorithms. Arson’s group studied the mechanisms of plant root growth in natural soil and the response of root architectures to obstacles to seek biomimetic solutions to demands for infrastructure network adaptation. The research team also designed image analysis tools to assess network resilience in slime mold, a protist, amoeba-like organism that grows by foraging.

His doctoral work focused on manipulating electronic and magnetic properties of complex oxides through the synthesis of atomically precise heterostructures. He then joined the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, Germany as a postdoctoral scientist, where he developed novel methods to control functional properties on ultrafast time scales using THz light. In 2017, he was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship. In 2019, he became a fellow of the Max Planck-NYC Center for Non-equilibrium Quantum Phenomena based at Columbia University. He returned to Cornell in July 2022 to join the faculty in Applied and Engineering Physics as an Assistant Professor where he leads the Disa Lab. Research in   centers around understanding and controlling the properties of quantum materials at the smallest length and time scales possible. Quantum materials are characterized by strong interactions that couple electron charges, spins, and orbitals, and the surrounding atomic lattice, leading to unique emergent phenomena, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, and topologically protected transport. These features could help address global technological challenges by enabling faster and more efficient information processing, enhanced energy harvesting and storage, scalable quantum computing, and more. In the Disa Lab, we seek to harness these quantum functionalities by combining ultrafast optical techniques with atomic layer synthesis. A major focus of our lab explores the use of light to dynamically control quantum phases and induce new non-equilibrium functionalities on ultrafast (femto- to picosecond) timescales. Systems of interest include superconductors, magnets, ferroelectrics, and other electronically ordered solids. Key to this approach is the development of novel optical sources and nonlinear techniques to enable the study of structural and electronic excitations spanning the terahertz/infrared frequency range. We are especially interested in investigating non-equilibrium processes in artificially engineered heterostructures with atomic dimensions. By exploiting the ability to tune picometer scale structure, composition, and dimensionality in such heterostructures, our goal is to gain a microscopic understanding of how light-induced non-equilibrium phases form, how to control them, and how to functionalize them.

These robots can also form a diverse collective to provide more flexibility than a multifunctional robot. Advances in multi-scale manufacturing and the proliferation of small electronic devices have paved the way to realizing this vision with centimeter-scale robots. However, there remain significant challenges in making these highly-articulated mechanical devices fully autonomous due to the severe mass and power constraints. Helbling’s research looks at the integration of the control system, sensors, and power electronics within the strict weight and power constraints of these vehicles, taking a holistic approach to navigating the inherent tradeoffs in each component in terms of their size, mass, power, and computation requirements. Farrell did her postdoctoral work at Harvard University and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering with Professor Wood. She completed her graduate work with Professor Wood in 2019, where she focused on the systems-level design of the Harvard RoboBee, an insect-scale flapping-wing robot, and HAMR, a bio-inspired crawling robot. Her work on the first autonomous flight of a centimeter-scale vehicle was recently featured on the cover of Nature, and can be seen at the Boston Museum of Science, World Economic Forum, London Science Museum, and the Smithsonian, as well as in the popular press (The New York Times, PBS NewsHour, Science Friday, and the BBC).

He received his undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece in 1995. As a student at NTUA, he was an active member of the environmentalist student group. He worked for a year as a research assistant at the Computational Fluid Dynamics laboratory at NTUA focusing on the development of a multifractal cascade model for fluid turbulence. \nFrom 1996 to 2001, he pursued graduate studies at the Mechanical and Aerospace Department (formerly Applied Mechanics and Engineering Sciences Dept.) of the University of California, San Diego. Following extensive coursework in fluid dynamics and physical oceanography, his PhD thesis concentrated on using direct numerical simulations of stratified homogeneous turbulence to better understand ocean microstructure measurements. \nUpon receiving his PhD, he became a postdoctoral researcher in the fluid dynamics group at the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southern California. His postdoc work focused on the development and implementation of numerically stable spectral multidomain techniques and the numerical investigation of stably stratified turbulent wakes and instabilities under internal solitary waves. Peter Diamessis's research at Cornell is focused along two main themes. One is the development of high-accuracy and high-resolution spectral quadrilateral subdomain penalty techniques for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations which enable as realistic as possible an approximation to the environmental flow processes of interest. The other consists of using these techniques as the driver of highly parallel simulations which provide an accurate description of the relevant physical phenomena over as broad a range and separation of scales and as long a duration as possible.

{"prof_name": "David Lee Hysell", "bio": "David Hysell earned his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1992. Hysell investigates ionospheric plasma physics with a focus on plasma instabilities, ionospheric irregularities, and their effects on radio wave propagation. Communication outages caused by ionospheric irregularities are a central component of the National Space Weather Program. The instabilities of interest are found in the equatorial and auroral electrojets, in the midlatitude E region ionosphere, and in equatorial and midlatitude spread F. The research is both experimental and theoretical and has a substantial computational component. An important research tool for studying the equatorial ionosphere is the Jicamarca Radio Observatory near Lima, Peru, the world's largest radar. In the spring of 2005, Hysell became the PI for the NSF Cooperative Agreement that supports Jicamarca. The ionosphere and the instabilities and irregularities that inhabit it are mainly studied with remote sensing using radar. Processing and interpreting both kinds of signals turns out to be demanding, and conventional analysis techniques are fraught with artifacts and ambiguity. Hysell's research focuses mainly on redefining the way radars are used to study the ionosphere and on improving closure between theory and experiment. As the radar techniques developed by Hysell's group are often applicable in other disciplines, including commercial and defense-related fields, this work has overtones outside aeronomy. Much of Hysell's research is conducted at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, the world's largest radar, located outside Lima, Peru. Jicamarca is owned by the Peruvian government but funded mainly through a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation and Cornell University. Hysell became the PI for the cooperative agreement in 2005, helping to maintain Cornell's leadership in aeronomy, space physics, and radar remote sensing. Jicamarca provides an ideal environment for developing, prototyping, and testing new radar techniques, modes, and instrumentation. Once developed, Hysell strives to migrate new radar techniques to different geographic regions for wider application. The strategy is accomplished through the construction and deployment of portable radar systems to middle- and high-latitude sites (the Caribbean and Alaska in particular).

She graduated from Clemson University with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering in 2011 and a Ph.D. in Engineering and Science Education in 2014. She joined the School of Engineering Education at Purdue University upon graduation, receiving tenure as well as a joint appointment in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering in 2020. Her research focuses on four main areas including 1) research on how diverse students in engineering navigate their pathways into and through engineering, with a particular focus on engineering identity development; 2) effective pedagogies and practices for an inclusive engineering education; 3) engineering workforce development; and 4) building capacity for engineering education research, particularly in chemical engineering. Her research earned a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2016 focused on characterizing latent diversity, which includes diverse attitudes, mindsets, and approaches to learning to understand engineering students’ identity development. She is the Past Chair of the American Society for Engineering Education Educational Research (ASEE ERM) and Methods Division (2021-2023) and an Associate Editor for Chemical Engineering Education (2020-Present) and the Journal of Engineering Education (2023-Present). Her research has won numerous best paper awards including the 2023 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Award for Excellence in Engineering Education Research Award, the 2022 American Educational Research Association Education in the Professions (Division I) 2021-2022 Outstanding Research Publication Award, and the 2021 Chemical Engineering Education William H. Corcoran Award. She is also an award-winning teacher and graduate mentor. Allison Godwin’s research focuses on changing the culture of engineering through research to make the discipline more inclusive of all types of people from K-12 through higher education and into engineering industry. She investigates how diverse people develop identities as engineers and how their multiple identities—including gender, race/ethnicity, among others—impact their inclusion, recruitment, persistence, and career trajectories. Identity in a particular role, like engineering, emphasizes that how students make sense of what it means to be a professional within their field can reveal information about how they understand who they are in the world, whom they can become, and if they belong.  She conducts mixed methods research, which includes large-scale quantitative studies and “small n” qualitative studies through surveys, interventions, interviews, focus groups, and other data collection techniques. Using both of these data streams provides the ability to understand general trends as well as rich and nuanced findings from individual’s lived experiences. Professor Godwin has developed and tested effective pedagogies in an introductory chemical engineering course to reduce high failure rates and strengthen students’ motivation. This work has had direct impact on student retention and success rates at Purdue University. She is studying how low-cost, low-effort classroom interventions can address equity gaps in academic performance in first and second-year engineering courses. Professor Godwin has also worked with emerging engineering education scholars to promote engineering education development in methods, publications, and CAREER grant applications.", "research_interests": [{"text": "Engineering Education", "link": "/engineering-education"}, "Allison Godwin’s research focuses on changing the culture of engineering through research to make the discipline more inclusive of all types of people from K-12 through higher education and into engineering industry.

His research group develops and implements systems bioengineering approaches to study the transcriptional and signaling network dysregulations underlying the decline of muscle stem cell function and tissue regeneration in aging and disease. The Cosgrove Laboratory is a group of biomedical engineers, stem cell biologists, and systems biologists that are broadly interested in understanding how muscle stem cells use the integrative action of their regulatory circuitry to interpret and balance diverse streams of microenvironmental \"information\". They explore these questions by: (1) Developing single-cell analysis and modeling approaches to deconstruct how muscle stem cell fate outcomes are dictated by diverse niche microenvironmental signals; (2) Elucidating the logic of autocrine and paracrine signaling networks influencing muscle stem cells fate decisions in homeostatic and regenerating muscle; and (3) Engineering biomimetic microenvironments for evaluating stem cell-niche interactions and exploiting them for cell manufacturing application. These approaches will enable the improvement of rationally designed, quantitatively predicable stem cell-targeted regenerative medicine therapies to treat tissue aging and degeneration. Visit   for more information. Dr. Cosgrove earned a bachelor’s in biomedical engineering at the University of Minnesota, a Ph.D. in bioengineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision of Dr. Douglas Lauffenburger and Dr. Linda Griffith, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Stanford University School of Medicine with Dr. Helen Blau.

He is now the  naugural vice president and executive director of Virginia Tech's new Innovation Campus. Under Dean Collins’ leadership, Cornell Engineering has maintained its rank as one of the top engineering colleges in the world. He was part of the leadership team that successfully bid to partner with New York City to build Cornell Tech, which opened its Roosevelt Island campus in 2017. He is leading one of the largest capital campaigns in the college’s history, aimed at renovating most engineering buildings to accommodate the college’s 10-year strategic plan for growth. Dean Collins has accelerated the college’s efforts to diversify its faculty and student body. Since 2007, Cornell Engineering more than doubled the proportion of underrepresented minority students from 7 to 19 percent. Over the same period, undergraduate female enrollment increased from 28 to 47 percent, more than twice the national average. And the Class of 2021 is the first in the college’s history to contain more women than men. For these efforts he received the inaugural Mosaic Medal of Distinction from Cornell Mosaic. He has also overseen a boom in entrepreneurship programming at Cornell Engineering with the establishment of many new programs and incubators built to foster commercialization and help bring new technologies from bench to market. Collins serves on Cornell’s Senior Leaders Climate Action Group, focused on improving climate trends by spurring cross-disciplinary solutions on campus and globally, including the ambitious Earth Source Heat project that aims to heat Cornell’s 745-acre campus with geothermal energy. Collins is a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and his research is focused on the application of direct numerical simulation to a broad range of turbulent processes. He received his B.S. from Princeton University and his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. The Mosaic Medal of Distinction recognizes alumni, faculty, and administrators for their commendable impact or leadership in creating opportunities and access for diverse communities within the academy, industry, public service, and the professions. This is the first year the medal is being awarded. Professor Collins' research interests are on the application of direct numerical simulation to a broad range of turbulent processes. Areas of current interest include: (i) turbulent coagulation of aerosol particles; (ii) experimental and numerical evaluation of Lagrangian statistics in turbulent flows; (iii) mixing and chemical reaction in turbulent flames; (iv) turbulent breakup of microstructures (e.g., drops, polymers and red blood cells); (v) drag reduction due to polymer additives. A unifying theme is the importance of fine-­--scale (micro-­--turbulence) transport to these phenomena. A second focus is on developing a new class of turbulence models that are capable of describing micro-­--turbulence processes.

He joined the Cornell faculty in November 1997. Cowen earned a B.S. (1987) in civil engineering at Brown University. He worked for three years at Redniss and Mead, a Stamford, CT based consulting firm that specializes in site planning and engineering. It was at Redniss and Mead that Cowen got a taste for hydrology, hydraulics and environmental fluid mechanics. Cowen returned to school and completed his M.S. (1991) and Ph.D. (1997) in civil engineering at Stanford University specializing in environmental fluid mechanics. \nCowen's research interests are in environmental fluid mechanics, renewable energy and sustainability. He pairs laboratory-based research with full-scale observational field campaigns to understand the physics of natural and anthropogenic flows in the environment. He has built an environmental fluid mechanics research program centered on five themes: environmental transport processes, water wave induced flows, lake hydrodynamics (physical limnology), energy harvesting, and quantitative imaging techniques. He has developed experimental techniques, built new facilities, and undertaken basic research in: the dispersal of mass by jets and low-momentum point sources; scale-dependent dispersion, swash zone (the region of the beach face that is alternately dry and wet) turbulence; wave-structure interaction; exchange processes at embayment-lake connections; residence time in natural water bodies; internal waves in lakes and reservoirs, the effects of aquatic vegetation (macrophytes) on the mass and momentum transport processes, gas transfer by turbulence at an air-water interface, sediment suspension by turbulence at a sediment-water interface, direct mechanical and kinetic energy harvesting, and the remote measurement of flow metrics from visible and infrared sensing. His current projects include infrared-based remotely sensing of surface turbulence to understand how juvenile fish are transported through the San Francisco Bay Delta system, optimizing strategies for energy harvesting from arrays of turbines, directly harvesting mechanical energy from pre-tensioned wave-like ribbons, the fate, transport and residence time of water masses and environmental DNA in Cayuga Lake, and the direct air capture of carbon dioxide for biofuel and co-product production. \nCowen believes strongly in multidisciplinary, cross-university collaborative research in the broad area of sustainability. Cowen has a particular interest in collaborating with external partners for real-world impact, such as his work with Avangrid (parent company of New York State Electric and Gas Corporation) to create, test, and optimize new residential electric storage systems as part of the   initiative. This cutting-edge academic-private industry National Science Foundation sponsored collaboration is testing whether coupling rechargeable batteries to residential smart meters can increase benefits, including bolstering power grid flexibility, integrating renewable energy sources, reducing household electricity costs, and empowering homeowners to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. \nCowen has been a member since 1999 of the Technical Advisory Committee on Cornell's   project, an award-winning district cooling system, and is a member of the executive steering team for Cornell's innovative   project which seeks to tap deep geothermal energy to heat Cornell’s campus. He was a member of Cornell's Senior Leadership Climate Action Group, which issued the report \"Options for Achieving a Carbon Neutral Campus by 2035\".

During the 2017-2019 academic years, he was a postdoctoral research fellow in LIDS of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at MIT. Before that, Goldfeld graduated with a B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. (all summa cum laude) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Ben Gurion University, Israel, in 2012, 2012 and 2017, respectively. Goldfeld's research interests include optimal transport theory, information theory, mathematical statistics, and applied probability. He develops mathematical tools for the design and analysis of modern inference and learning systems, with the goal of devising algorithms that are accurate, scalable, robust, private, and fair.  Many learning tasks, from generative modeling to style transfer, can be distilled into a question of comparing or deriving transformations between complex, high-dimensional probability distributions.

Popular classes of divergences include Wasserstein distances (rooted in optimal transport theory), f-divergences, integral probability metrics, and more.

His research interests include Nanomaterials for Energy, Biomedical, and Environmental Applications. His group is internationally recognized as one of the leading groups in nanohybrids and nanocomposites.

He has won the 2014 Cooperative Research Award from the American Chemical Society, and he is a member of the European Academy of Sciences. Nanoscale Materials for Energy and Sustainability The prosperity and wealth of any nation significantly depend on its energy resources. Making good investments in energy production and its uses will become even more critical in the future as the population grows, the economy expands and demands for sustainability intensify. In recent years \"storm clouds\" have been forming at the interface of energy resources, environment, and climate change that demand concerted action by scientists, engineers, and policy makers. Materials innovation can provide unique technological opportunities for addressing some of these challenges. Research efforts in our group have focused on the following four current sectors: \nCarbon Capture and Conversion Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 due to increasing consumption of fossil fuels have been widely implicated in global climate change. Post-combustion carbon capture by retrofitting the existing energy infrastructure provides a viable near-term solution to reduce CO2 emissions. While some progress has been made in developing materials for capture, processes to store safely CO2 are still a major challenge. In fact, a more preferable method involves conversion of CO2 into chemicals. The advantage of such a process is that one can simultaneously reduce the CO2 levels in the atmosphere and also provide value-added chemicals from sustainable sources using green processes. \nMembranes for Gas Separation and Water Purification Mixed matrix membranes (MMM) combining the advantages of both polymers and inorganic materials have become the focus of next generation gas separation membranes. However, issues associated with the poor interaction between the particles and the polymer can lead to particle aggregation and the presence of nonselective voids both of which compromise the performance of the membrane. Our efforts have focused on new gas separation membranes onto which a thin layer of porous (MOF, ZIF and zeolite) or non-porous nanoparticles has been immobilized. \nA similar immobilization approach is being used to develop patterned surfaces with well-defined hydrophobic/hydrophilic features. Such systems have been proposed for practical, water harvesting systems in countries, which suffer from negligible rainfalls but experience desert fogs. The approach leverages our on-going work to develop non-fouling water membranes by tailoring the membrane surface characteristics via nanoparticle deposition. By properly selecting the nanoparticle and the polymeric membranes robust and scalable systems that do not affect the transport properties of the membrane have been developed. \nEnergy Storage: Batteries and Supercapacitors Efficient energy storage remains a critical need for developing renewable energy systems. In addition to storing electrical energy from renewable sources and, thus, solving the intermittency problem associated with them, batteries are key components in various portable electronic devices and in hybrid electric vehicles. Research efforts in batteries have focused on both the electrodes as well as the electrolyte. Electrolytes play a critical role for the battery's efficient and safe performance and need to meet a range of specific requirements. Solvent-free electrolytes with low flammability and toxicity are of great interest to avoid any potential fire hazards. In parallel, several issues with the present cathode materials have led to a search of new systems. Lithium-sulfur is one such system that has theoretical specific capacity and specific energy, which are almost an order of magnitude higher than the current lithium-ion batteries. Sulfur is also non-toxic, highly abundant and cheap. Yet, there are many problems associated with this system, primarily, lower than theoretical specific capacities and poor cycle life. \nOil and Gas Exploration and Production Development and deployment of new, reliable and practical tracers to illuminate an oil reservoir can help delineate waterflood fronts, identify bypassed oil, and map super permeability zones. The capabilities become limitless with the possibility of developing agents that, in addition to illuminating the reservoir, they provide the means to intervene to recover oil or rectify adverse transport conditions. Nanoparticles are small enough to fit through the smallest pores (~50 nm) in the reservoir but much larger than molecular tracers and, therefore, recoverable. Nanoparticle tracers can, thus, yield information much faster because of differences in diffusion and flow behavior.

The Fatemi Lab cross-pollinates quantum materials and quantum coherent devices to develop new scientific insights and proof-of-principle quantum information technologies.

Furthermore, the lab will explore new materials platforms in the search for better foundations for conceptually standard electrodynamical qubits. Concepts from geometric topology have revolutionized our understanding of materials and quantum states.

Exotic quantum phases of electrons in materials are often fragile, only appearing at the lowest temperatures and in the cleanest samples. Consequently, experimental probes or processes are liable to perturb or damage the materials in ways that disrupt the correlated electronic phases.

Furthermore, the lab will explore new materials platforms in the search for better foundations for conceptually standard electrodynamical qubits.", "Concepts from geometric topology have revolutionized our understanding of materials and quantum states. These led to ideas in which the topology of a wave-function may result in protected states that robustly preserve quantum information. We are interested in developing new experiments to show that these kinds of quantum wavefunctions can be constructed, whether in a natural material or in an engineered system, and to evaluate their performance in realistic environments.", "Exotic quantum phases of electrons in materials are often fragile, only appearing at the lowest temperatures and in the cleanest samples. Consequently, experimental probes or processes are liable to perturb or damage the materials in ways that disrupt the correlated electronic phases. We will adapt new experimental tools inspired by the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, which was developed to read and manipulate quantum states without disturbing their coherence, to detect and learn about the most delicate quantum phases of electronic matter."], "selected_publications": [], "awards": [], "education": [], "in_the_news": [], "related_links": [], "teaching_interests": [], "websites": [["The Fatemi Lab", "https://fatemilab.aep.cornell.edu"]]},

{"prof_name": "Shefford P. Baker", "bio": "After an undergraduate degree in Music and a brief career as a professional musician and music teacher, Shefford P. Baker studied Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science. He received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University in 1993, was a staff scientist at the Max-Planck-Institut für Metallforschung in Stuttgart from 1993 to 1997 and joined the Cornell faculty in 1998. He was Visiting Professor at the Faculté des Sciences et Techniques de Saint Jérome, Université Paul Cézanne, Marseille, in summer 2006. Baker has received several teaching awards at Cornell. Baker’s research focuses on the unique mechanical properties of materials having microstructural or dimensional length scales in the nanometer regime. Work in the group can be divided into two broad areas. \nThin Films and Nanopatterned Structures are the basic building blocks of micro- and nano-fabricated devices, but may have mechanical properties that are very different from those of the same materials in bulk form. We want to understand (and utilize) these unique properties. We produce films with good control of interface chemistry and composition using high- and ultra-high vacuum physical vapor deposition techniques; characterize their microstructures using electron backscattered diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and many other methods; and study their thermomechanical behavior using substrate curvature, x-ray diffraction, and others. We model the microstructure and stress states in detail in order to understand processing-structure-properties relationships. Recent achievements include discovery of a new microstructure in Ta thin films and characterization of the phase transformation that produces it, x-ray studies of stress states and relaxation in different texture components in thin metal films, dislocation dynamics simulations and analytical modeling of dislocation structures in thin layers, and quantitative measurements of bonding at interfaces by time-dependent delamination experiments. \nNanocontact Measurements are a powerful method for interrogating mechanical behavior on an extremely fine scale. Recently, with a team of collaborators, we have been using these methods to investigate structure-property relationships in the lamellar and interlamellar regions in trabecular bone as a function of age and vitamin D deficiency. \nResearch Projects \n* Stresses and Deformation Mechanisms in Thin Metal Films: Combining Modeling with Experiments. In this NSF-funded project, we are studying how the evolution of grain and dislocation structures affects stress states, strength and strain hardening in thin metal films. We use discrete dislocation dynamics to study dislocation structures and compare the results with experimental measurements of microstructure and stresses. \n*Microstructure and Mechanical Behavior of Tantalum Thin Films: Ta is an amazingly versatile and useful material in micro- and nano-fabricated devices. In this NSF-funded project, we are analyzing the long-range orientation gradients and discontinuous grain boundary structure in a new microstructure that we discovered in phase-transformed Ta thin films using experimental and computational methods. \n*Stresses and Deformation in Different Texture Components in Thin Films: Thin films often form with more than one group of preferred crystallographic orientations, or textures. Since most materials are highly anisotropic at the nanoscale, these differently-oriented components have very different properties. With support from Applied Materials Corp. we study how these texture components behave in-situ using x-ray diffraction at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. \n*A Materials Research Approach to Bone: Nanometer Scale Microstructure and Mechanical Properties: Bone is a complex composite material with structure and organization at many length scales.

Our interests lie at the intersection of Condensed matter/materials physics and solid state chemistry and can be broadly characterized as centered on the use of theory to elucidate the fundamental principles that govern the relationship between the structure and the macroscopic behavior of complex bulk, thin film, and heterostructured materials in which lattice, magnetic, orbital, and/or electronic degrees of freedom are active. \nIn this regard we are particularly interested in understanding how the composition, symmetry, geometry, and topology of crystalline motifs influence the interplay among the active degrees-of-freedom, how this subsequently manifests itself in the macroscopic properties, and if this interplay can be controlled so as to produce \"designer\" properties and functionalities. \nWe are fascinated by systems in which understanding the structural complexity is key to explaining their macroscopic properties and in particular by systems under extreme environments where chemical intuition often breaks down.

Afterward, he moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara as a postdoctoral associate. In 2011, he joined the Cornell faculty of Applied and Engineering Physics. In 2012 he received a Young Investigator Award from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, in 2013 he received an Early Faculty Career Award from the National Science Foundation along with the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, and in 2014 he received the Early Career Award from the Department of Energy. The Fuchs Group focuses on quantum informa­tion science and spintronics. We study and manipulate spin and optical degrees of freedom in solid-state materials. Although we are primarily a condensed matter physics research group, we draw inspiration from many fields including atomic physics, materials science, and electrical engineering. \n  \nWe are interested in hybrid quantum systems, in which disparate degrees of freedom interact coherently. Such systems can form the basis of future quantum technologies such as quantum repeat­ers and quantum transducers. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers are an important platform for our research because they possess a coherent optical transition, long-lived spin coher­ence, and several mechanisms for coupling to external degrees of freedom – mechanical, magnetic, and electrical. NV center-based hybrid systems form outstanding quantum-enhanced sensors for a range of applications from nanoscience to naviga­tion and they can form the backbone of a quantum network. In addition to diamond NV centers, also examine emerging defect centers in wide band-gap materials for quantum applications.  \n  \nIn an emerging research area within the group, we are interested in a hybrid quantum system based on superconducting microwave circuits and ultra-low damping magnetic materials.  We have recently demonstrated the integration of these two disparate elements in a way that allows us to design waveguides microwave photons and magnons on an equal basis, enabling controlled and strong interactions.  We are interested in using these structures for a variety of experiments ranging from the demonstration of nonreciprocal quantum circuit elements to the creation of quantum states of magnons. \n  \nAnother focus is understanding spins and spin dynamics in materials to enable future technologies based on spin.

He completed postdoctoral fellowships in the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in the Center for Biomedical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He currently serves on the editorial board of the journal Tissue Engineering. Dr. Bonassar's research group focuses on the regeneration and analysis of musculoskeletal tissues, including bone and cartilage. The approach involves a multidisciplinary strategy using techniques in biomechanics, biomaterials, cell biology, and biochemistry. Applications of this technology include the repair of articular cartilage, intervertebral disc, trachea and craniofacial defects. At the cellular level, this work focuses on understanding the interactions of chondrocytes, fibroblasts and stem cells with biomaterials. This includes grafting of cell adhesion peptides to polymers and characterizing the effects of these alterations on the way in which cells sense their environment. Of specific interest is the extent to which intrinsic mechanical properties and externally applied forces control chondrocyte matrix assembly. The third focus area of the group is understanding structure-property relationships in native and engineered tissues. This involves experimental correlation of tissue mechanical properties with biochemical composition as well as mathematical modeling of tissue assembly processes and structure-property relationships. Dr. Bonassar has been working with M.Eng. Director and a student team, with an industry sponsor to develop a tissue fusion system that uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to repair partial tears of the meniscus.

In 1974-75 he was a senior visiting fellow of the Science Research Council at Leeds University in England, and a visiting fellow at Twente University of Technology in The Netherlands. \nHe returned to The Netherlands and England in 1982-83 as a Fulbright fellow at Eindhoven University of Technology and a visiting professor at Durham University.

Earlier work on the dynamics of isolated journal bearings resulted in a uniquely efficient \"mobility method\" of analysis, now widely used by industry in the design of engine bearings. Studies of the dynamics of more complex bearing, shaft, and housing systems (in both rotating and reciprocating machinery) have combined nonlinear simulation and/or locally-linearized analysis with automated modeling of the structural components of a system. Application of the finite element method to the detailed study of fluid film behavior has resulted in a novel and physically intuitive direct approach, together with a more powerful indirect, or variational, approach.

{"prof_name": "Joel Donald Brock", "bio": "After receiving his doctoral degree, Brock spent two years as a postdoctoral research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then joined the Cornell faculty in 1989. He served as Director of the School of Applied & Engineering Physics from 2000-2007. At Cornell, he is affiliated with the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR), the Energy Materials Center at Cornell (emc2), and is Director of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS).

Brock is a fellow of the American Physical Society. For over 100 years, our fundamental understanding of the structure of materials on atomic length scales has been advanced by direct structural measurements using x-rays. Modern synchrotrons provide over 8 orders of magnitude higher fluxes than laboratory based sources. This flux enables us to utilize higher resolution: higher angular resolution for diffraction, higher energy resolution for spectroscopies, higher time resolution for dynamics, and higher spatial resolution for imaging. We employ modern synchrotron-based x-ray techniques to measure the structure directly on length-scales ranging from 1 - 50,000Å on time scales ranging from 10  - 10  seconds. We are currently concentrating our studies on pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of complex oxide thin films. \nThe desire to manufacture devices with characteristic features on (sub)nanometer length scales has driven an enormous effort to create thin films with precisely controlled chemical composition, crystal structure and morphology. Energetic processing techniques offer the enticing prospect of gaining additional control at the nanoscale over thin-film deposition and processing. However, our fundamental understanding of non-thermal growth and surface processing is in an early stage of development. We are studying the fundamental processes governing deposition via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Empirically, by tuning the substrate temperature, background gas pressure, laser pulse rate, and energy density of the laser pulse, high quality films of many cubic perovskite (e.g., colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), piezoelectric, and high TC superconducting materials) can be grown using PLD. Our time-resolved x-ray structural measurements directly test proposed growth models. This research program is a component of the CCMR's IRG-3 and is based at CHESS. \nI am also working to develop the next generation of x-ray sources. LINAC based x-ray sources such as (pulsed) X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) and (cw) Energy Recovery LINACs (ERLs) will create diffraction limited and degenerate x-ray beams that will enable coherent and time-resolved techniques previously only possible with optical lasers. Our long term goal is to generate, manipulate, and utilize coherent x-ray beams for atomic-scale structural measurements on the relevant fundamental time-scales. Discovering and optimizing catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion processes, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are critical steps on the path towards developing renewable energy production and storage technologies. These two reactions are central to water-splitting, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries.

{"prof_name": "Lara A. Estroff", "bio": "Lara A. Estroff received her B.A. with honors from Swarthmore College (1997), with a major in Chemistry and a minor in Anthropology. Before beginning her graduate studies, she spent a year at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel as a visiting researcher in the labs of Profs Lia Addadi and Steve Weiner. During this time, she was introduced to the field of biomineralization and studied chemical approaches to archeological problems. In 2003, she received her Ph.D. in Chemistry from Yale University for work done in Prof. Andrew D. Hamilton's laboratory on the design and synthesis of bio-inspired organic superstructures to control the growth of inorganic crystals. After completing graduate school, she was an NIH-funded postdoctoral fellow in Prof. George M. Whiteside's laboratory at Harvard University (2003-2005). Since 2005, Dr. Estroff has been in Materials Science and Engineering department at Cornell University and in 2019 she was promoted to Full Professor. She served as the Director of Graduate Studies in the department from 2015-2019. As of August 2020, she is the current Chair of the Materials Science and Engineering department. Her group focuses on bio-inspired materials synthesis, crystal growth mechanisms, and the high-resolution characterization of pathological mineralization. She has received several awards, including an NSF Early Faculty Career Award in 2009 and a J.D. Watson Young Investigator’s award from NYSTAR in 2006. In 2023, Estroff was named the Herbert Fisk Johnson Professor of Industrial Chemistry by the College of Engineering. The diversity of biomineralized structures, ranging from magnetic nanoparticles in bacteria to large, single-crystalline sea urchin spines to the hierarchical composite structure of bone, has inspired the study of structure-function relationships within naturally occurring materials, and the development of synthetic routes to organic-inorganic composites with complex morphologies and desirable materials properties. Central to the study of biomineralization, and still poorly understood, are the multiple crystallization pathways by which the organisms control the structures and properties of the final products. Once these pathways are understood, they become synthetically powerful for designing new materials and developing low-cost, solution-based approaches to functional materials. In addition to normal, physiological biomineralization, a related field is the study of pathlogical mineralization,  , conditions in which the normal pathways have become disrupted.  Here too, unraveling the crystallization pathways is essential to aid in the discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for treating diseases linked with pathological mineralization.

The Kwan lab applies systems neuroscience and neuroengineering approaches to the study of mental health. We develop optical imaging techniques to visualize neural structure and activity dynamics in awake mice. We design quantitative paradigms to characterize behavior. We often complement the imaging and behavioral experiments with other molecular, electrophysiological, optical, and computational methods. Current effort in the lab is directed towards understanding drug action in the brain. Psychiatric drugs exert powerful effects in humans characterized by altered perception, cognition, and mood. Our recent studies focus on compounds such as ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics that may be promising for treating depression. We want to know how these drugs produce therapeutic behavioral effects through modifying the connectivity and functions of neural circuits. We leverage the neurobiological insights to develop novel screening methods for preclinical drug development. Our long-term goal is to discover effective and safe strategies for treating depression.

Her lab's strategy is to develop novel tools to image the contribution of multiple physiological systems to diseases with in vivo animal models. To study these systems at their full complexity in the complete living animal, they use multiphoton microscopy to image cell dynamics in rodents. They also use femtosecond laser ablation and quantitative analysis to dissect function in the living system. In diseases as diverse as cardiovascular disease and cancer metastasis, the microvasculature provides an avenue of access for immune and inflammatory cells.

{"prof_name": "Eric Sander Lavine", "bio": "Dr. Lavine received his Ph.D. in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at the University of Washington for his work on the MOCHI Labjet experiment—an astrophysically relevant laboratory plasma jet with self-organized magnetic fields and stabilizing helical shear flows. He joined the Cornell Laboratory of Plasma Studies in the spring of 2018 as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, focusing on the dynamics and stability of gas-puff z-pinch implosions. His expertise is in the field of experimental high energy density (HED) plasma physics, where he has acquired significant experience in the application of pulsed-power technologies and advanced diagnostics. His current research interests include the dynamics of z-pinch implosions, laboratory astrophysics, plasma relaxation and self-organization, power-flow, plasma turbulence, and diagnostic development. His overarching scientific mission is to improve the understanding of plasma dynamics that inform magnetic, inertial, and magneto-inertial fusion, intense radiation sources, advanced space propulsion, and astrophysical plasmas. Unlike the familiar states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) in which particle interactions are governed by short-range collisions, particles in a plasma also exhibit long-range interactions (i.e., collective motion) mediated by electric and magnetic fields. From a fluid point of view, these fields can drive bulk plasma flows and vice versa. Understanding these interactions and the corresponding effect on overall plasma stability remains a central problem in plasma physics and informs magnetic, inertial, and magneto-inertial fusion concepts, advanced space propulsion, and the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas. In many cases, the spontaneous emergence of flows, magnetic structures, and instabilities highlights the need for careful consideration of the coupling between plasma flows and electromagnetic fields during plasma self-organization and relaxation. A major focus of my research therefore aims to elucidate the details of these interactions, whether it be understanding instability growth and turbulence in gas-puff z-pinch implosions, or magnetically driven helical shear flows in astrophysically relevant laboratory plasma jets. Pulsed-power driven magneto-inertial fusion (MIF) schemes are particularly attractive due to the high coupling efficiency, magnetically reduced thermal transport, and magnetically enhanced alpha heating. These features open a wide new parameter space for achieving fusion that bridges the gap between traditional magnetic and inertial confinement approaches. The density regime of MIF is already a relatively unexplored area of magnetized plasma physics, allowing for many opportunities of fundamental research. However, to produce such plasmas in the first place, the details of driver-target coupling are critically important. For example, driver currents in excess of 60 MA with rise times of hundreds of nanoseconds are believed to be required to achieve fusion ignition for a variety of pulsed-power-driven concepts. Delivering such currents from large capacitor banks to small targets several cm in height and tens to hundreds of microns in diameter at stagnation is an extreme challenge. Fundamental questions associated with this challenge include: Can we accurately predict the current distribution and delivery to imploding targets? What limits current delivery to small radii? How is the current delivery affected by the changing load inductance during an implosion? What limits current delivery through magnetically insulated transmission lines, and can material and surface conditions improve performance? Diagnostics are critical for measuring plasma conditions, understanding plasma dynamics, and assessing progress towards fusion conditions. However, diagnosing such extreme states of matter, which persist in very small regions in space and time is not trivial. In the Laboratory of Plasma Studies, we are proud to boast one of the best diagnostic suites of any University-scale pulsed-power driver in the world. Optical diagnostics include visible, UV, and X-ray imaging and spectroscopy (both time gated, and streaked). Laser-based diagnostics include optical Thomson scattering, interferometry, Faraday polarimetry, and imaging refractometry. X-ray sources known as x-pinches, can be leveraged for point radiography to study the properties of near-solid density plasmas at millions of degrees. And other standard probes such as inductive loop probes to measure magnetic fields, photodetectors to measure x-ray emission, and more are available in the laboratory. Many of the diagnostics listed above can be fielded simultaneously on a single experimental shot to provide a comprehensive picture of the plasma conditions.

{"prof_name": "Jan Lammerding", "bio": "Jan Lammerding is faculty in the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at Cornell University. After obtaining a Diploma Ingenieur degree in Mechanical Engineering in his native Germany, he completed his Ph.D. in Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying subcellular biomechanics and mechanotransduction signaling in the laboratories of Roger Kamm (MIT) and Richard T. Lee (Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital). Before joining Cornell University, Dr. Lammerding served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital while also teaching in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. Dr. Lammerding has won several prestigious awards, including a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an American Heart Association Scientist Development Grant, and the BWH Department of Medicine Young Investigator Award. Dr. Lammerding was featured as one of the 2014 Young Innovators in the Cell and Molecular Bioengineering Journal. Dr. Lammerding has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles, including in Nature, Science, and PNAS. His research is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program. Cells in the human body are continuously exposed to large physical forces and deformations. Examples include contracting muscle cells, cells in tendons, bones and cartilage, but also neutrophils or metastatic cancer cells that pass through narrow capillaries, exit blood vessels, and squeeze through dense tissues to reach distant sites in the body. Consequently, mutations that alter the mechanical properties of cells or their ability to withstand physical stress can result in debilitating diseases or facilitate the spreading of cancer. The research in the Lammerding Lab is focused on developing and applying novel experimental techniques to investigate this important interplay between cellular structure and function, with a particular emphasis on the cell nucleus. Inherited or novel mutations in nuclear proteins are responsible for a large number of human diseases, ranging from muscular dystrophies and cardiovascular disease to premature aging. Altered expression of nuclear envelope proteins have also been reported in several cancers, where they could modulate the ability of the normally stiff cell nucleus to deform and thereby promote the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Our interdisciplinary team is combining bioengineering approaches with cell and molecular biology techniques to design experimental assays to probe how such changes in cellular structure and mechanics can result in human disease. Specific examples include microfluidic devices to rapidly probe the mechanical properties of cells and to assess the ability of cancer cells to pass through narrow constrictions, as well as micro-engineered substrates to study the differentiation and maturation of normal and mutant stem cells. In addition, we are developing molecular tension sensors that will enable us to measure the molecular forces transmitted between the cell and the nucleus, which is highly relevant to the normal function of muscle cells and to the invasion of cancer cells. These in vitro studies are complemented by studies on mouse models of human diseases to assess the relevance of our findings in vivo. Insights gained from these studies will improve our understanding of normal cellular function and can offer important clues into the development of new treatment approaches for muscular dystrophies, cardiovascular disease, premature aging, and cancer.", "research_interests": [{"text": "Bioengineering", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/bioengineering"}, {"text": "Biomechanics and Mechanobiology", "link": "/biomechanics-and-mechanobiology"}, {"text": "Biomedical Engineering", "link": "/biomedical-engineering"}, {"text": "Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine", "link": "/drug-delivery-and-nanomedicine"}, {"text": "Mechanics of Biological Materials", "link": "/mechanics-biological-materials"}, {"text": "Microfluidics", "link": "/microfluidics"}, {"text": "Molecular and Cellular Engineering", "link": "/molecular-and-cellular-engineering"}, {"text": "Molecular Biotechnology", "link": "/molecular-biotechnology"}, {"text": "Nanobio Applications", "link": "/nanobio-applications"}, {"text": "Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials", "link": "/tissue-engineering-biomaterials"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "Denais, CM, RM Gilbert, P.

{"prof_name": "Karl Lewis", "bio": "  Dr. Karl Lewis joined the Meinig School as an assistant professor in July 2020. Dr. Lewis’s research interests center on understanding the interplay of mechanical cues and biological changes in musculoskeletal tissues. As a trained engineer, Dr. Lewis views the body as a system of sub-systems with a wide range of input and output signals. Cytokines, neurotransmitters, and hormones are some of the signals available for the body to use. Mechanical forces can modulate these signals and are critical for the health of musculoskeletal cells.  With this in mind, Dr. Lewis’s work seeks to understand how the acute sensing mechanisms in musculoskeletal cells relate to tissue-level changes in healthy and disease states. To interrogate these questions, Dr. Lewis works with cutting-edge intravital imaging techniques to observe cell signaling in real time. Using genetically modified mice, he and his collaborators are searching for proteins related to bone growth, development, and disease (i.e. osteoporosis).  Dr. Lewis comes to Cornell most recently from Indiana University School of Medicine, where he worked on two projects with Dr. Alex Robling as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology. One project investigated the role of neurotransmitters in osteocyte mechanobiology using genetically modified mice bred in-house. The second project utilized intravital fluorescent imaging techniques to observe changes in osteocyte calcium signaling a function of genetic modification or pharmacological intervention.  At Cornell, the Lewis laboratory will continue this research in bone and also develop new intravital imaging techniques for studying mechanotransduction in other musculoskeletal tissues. The lab will interrogate how the acute sensing mechanisms in musculoskeletal cells relate to tissue-level changes in healthy and disease states, with the objective to use this knowledge to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in musculoskeletal disease. Bone investigations will focus on understanding how bone cells interpret mechanical loading in real time using intravital imaging techniques. The lab will also work to understand how bone interacts with other neighboring tissues in the onset and progression of diseases like osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. ", "research_interests": [{"text": "Biomechanics and Mechanobiology", "link": "/biomechanics-and-mechanobiology"}, {"text": "Biomedical Engineering", "link": "/biomedical-engineering"}, {"text": "Molecular and Cellular Engineering", "link": "/molecular-and-cellular-engineering"}, {"text": "Image Analysis", "link": "/image-analysis"}, {"text": "Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation", "link": "/biomedical-imaging-and-instrumentation"}, {"text": "Bioengineering", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/bioengineering"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "KJ Lewis, RB-J Choi, EZ Pemberton, WA Bullock, AB Firulli, AG Robling, “Twist1 inactivation in Dmp1-expressing cells increases bone mass but does not affect the anabolic response to sclerostin neutralization,” ‎Int.

Lloyd is developing instrumentation and experimental techniques for the study of extrasolar planets with Adaptive optics and interferometry. He spent 2 years at the South Pole working on the South Pole Infrared Explorer (SPIREX), a 60cm telescope that operated from 1994-1999. This experiment characterized the properties of the South Pole for infrared astronomy and obtained some of the deepest near-infrared images of galaxies. He has developed instrumentation for the Lick laser guide star adaptive optics system, the InfraRed Camera for Adaptive optics at Lick (IRCAL).  He is the coronagraph architect for the Lyot project, which was commissioned at the Air Force 3.6m telescope in March 2004. This coronagraph is coupled with the most powerful AO system in the world, the 1000 actuator AEOS AO system. This is the first diffraction limited stellar coronagraph, and enters a new regime of search space due the high performance of the AO system. The Lyot project will survey the solar neighborhood for brown dwarf companions, planets and debris disks around nearby stars. As part of a larger collaboration, designs are being developed for an \"Extreme\" AO system for direct imaging of extrasolar planets with 10 meter class telescopes. The current focus of research is the synthesis of the techniques of aperture masking interferometry with AO to achieve precision image reconstruction and accurate calibration of AO data. The ZOR/AO instrument (Zero Optical Redundancy with Adaptive Optics) will push the performance of AO to the highest possible resolutions at visible wavelengths.

{"prof_name": "Peter McMahon", "bio": "Peter McMahon received a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering with a Physics minor from Stanford University in 2014 for research done on quantum information processing using optically controlled spins in semiconductors. He then performed postdoctoral work in the Department of Applied Physics at Stanford until he joined the faculty in the School of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell. Prior to attending graduate school at Stanford he spent one year at the University of California, Berkeley, working on instrumentation for radio astronomy and bioinformatics. He received his undergraduate education at the University of Cape Town. While at Stanford he was awarded a Stanford Graduate Fellowship (2008–2011) and a Stanford Nano- and Quantum Science and Engineering Postdoctoral Fellowship (2015–2017). The McMahon Lab researches the physics of computation, and how physical systems can be engineered to perform computation in new ways that provide benefits over current CMOS-based von Neumann processors. We have a particular emphasis on quantum computation, but we also explore other candidate future computing technologies that are classical, including photonic computing and neuromorphic computing. We are interested in multiple different physical platforms for quantum information processing, including spins in semiconductor devices, superconducting circuits, and quantum-optical systems. Each of these approaches to building quantum technologies has advantages and disadvantages, and we explore the fundamental physical limits of each, as well as work on pushing the experimental state-of-the-art. Besides working on building quantum computing and communication hardware in our experimental lab, we are also interested in studying the uses of quantum computers in the near term (noisy, intermediate-scale machines) and in the long term (fault-tolerant machines). We would like to learn if or how quantum computers can deliver benefits in the realms of optimization, quantum simulation, and machine learning. Quantum simulation was Feynman’s original motivation for proposing quantum computation, and it remains today one of the most promising potential uses of quantum computers, both with analog quantum simulators and with digital quantum simulations performed on universal circuit-model quantum computers. Quantum simulators should allow the study of the world of strongly correlated systems (for example, in quantum chemistry and in condensed-matter physics), and will hopefully lead to new physical insight and engineering capabilities in much the same way as the development of conventional computational physics did.

{"prof_name": "Matthew Peter Miller", "bio": "Professor Miller is interested in solid mechanics and the mechanical behavior of metals, engineering alloys, composites and semiconductors. Research areas include crystal stress measurements, microplasticity, fatigue crack initiation, high temperature behavior of superalloys, mechanical behavior of silicon, design and implementation of new in situ experiments with synchrotron x-rays, multiscale model development and validation. Educational areas focus on mechanics of materials, material selection, x-ray diffraction, graduate solid mechanics, mechanics of composites, experimental methods and state variable modeling. \nMatthew Miller joined the Sibley School faculty in January, 1994 and is currently a full Professor. Miller received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and his M.S. and Ph.D. from Georgia Tech. He was named the 1993 outstanding graduating Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and was inducted into the Georgia Tech. Council of Outstanding Young Engineering Alumni in 1995. Professor Miller spent a sabbatical leave at the Colorado School of Mines in 2000-2001, at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory in 2007 and The Ohio State University in 2008. Professor Miller has developed in situ mechanical testing / synchrotron x-ray experiments at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and at the APS. In 2011, he co-organized a workshop at the APS to explore the synergy between high energy synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments and high fidelity material behavior models. Miller is currently the Associate Director of CHESS and serves on the Section 1 Beamline Advisory Group at the APS. Professor Miller spent 6 years playing professional football before returning to obtain his engineering degrees. He played 4 years as an offensive lineman for the Cleveland Browns of the NFL and 2 years for the Denver Gold of the USFL. \nProfessor Miller has received several teaching and advising awards at Cornell. He was a Lilly Teaching Fellow in 1995, he won the Dennis Shepherd Award as the Outstanding Teacher in the Sibley School in 1996. Miller won the James and Mary Tien Excellence in Teaching Award in 2004 and the James M. Marsha D. McCormick Award for Excellence in Advising First Year Students in 2006 - both awarded by the Cornell College of Engineering. Professor Miller won an NSF CAREER Award in 1997 and participated in the National Academy of Engineering Frontiers of Engineering in 1999. He won the ASM International Henry Marion Howe Award in 2009 for the Best Research Paper in Metallurgical and Materials Transactions in 2008. Professor Miller is on the Editorial Advisory Board of the International Journal of Fatigue and is on the Review Board for Integrating Materials and Manufacturing Innovation. In 2022, he was elected the Willis H. Carrier Professor in Engineering. Miller's research focuses on the creation of tools that enable the design and selection of structural materials. Much of Miller's work is at the experiment/model interface, where he and his students have designed experiments to probe material state and behaviors on multiple size scales. An emphasis is the use of synchrotron x-rays and in-situ mechanical loading to understand the crystal level mechanical state of alloys during deformation - including monotonic loading and fatigue. Results from these experiments - which have been conducted on copper, aluminum, beryllium and titanium alloys - are enabling improved understanding of how micromechanical stress states evolve during plastic deformation and, eventually how damage such as a fatigue crack initiates.

Much of Miller's work is at the experiment/model interface, where he and his students have designed experiments to probe material state and behaviors on multiple size scales. An emphasis is the use of synchrotron x-rays and in-situ mechanical loading to understand the crystal level mechanical state of alloys during deformation - including monotonic loading and fatigue. Results from these experiments - which have been conducted on copper, aluminum, beryllium and titanium alloys - are enabling improved understanding of how micromechanical stress states evolve during plastic deformation and, eventually how damage such as a fatigue crack initiates.

Moses received his Ph.D. from Cornell in 2007, and his B.Sc. from Yale in 2001, with both degrees in applied physics. He is currently leading programs funded by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the Office of Naval Research. Jeff Moses’ research group focuses on (1) using light pulses to capture and control “ultrafast phenomena” (i.e., events so brief as to be barely detectable by state-of-the-art technology), and (2) on developing new concepts for generating and manipulating ultrashort light pulses when they are intense and as brief as a single optical cycle. We focus on using laser pulses analogously to strobe lights, in order to view and understand brief moments during the coordinated motions of electrons and coupled particles, or as impulses that produce new characteristics in materials by driving them out of equilibrium. Current systems of interest include light-activated biophysical systems, such as DNA and the human vision response, and highly correlated crystalline materials. Our projects include understanding molecular and material energy flow and using light to activate new material phases in crystals. We also look for ways to circumvent the normal rules that govern how intense, ultrashort light pulses behave in materials.

His work more generally has focused on the development of scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy as quantitative tools for atomic-resolution materials analysis, and its application to unraveling connections between electronic-structure changes on the atomic scale and the macroscopic behavior of materials. This includes systems as diverse as fuel cells, batteries, turbine blades, and two-dimensional superconductors. David is a fellow of both the American Physical Society and the Microscopy Society of America, and recipient of the DGE’s Ernst Ruska Prize, the MSA Burton Medal and MAS Duncumb Award.  My group's research at Cornell University is focused on understanding the behavior of materials and devices at the atomic scale, with an emphasis on renewable energy applications. Using some of the most powerful electron microscopes in the world, placed in specially-designed and environmentally isolated rooms, we are able to explore the chemistry, electronic structure and bonding inside objects as diverse as transistors, turbine blades, two-dimensional superconductors, fuel cells and batteries. All of these systems are made up of different materials, and where they join at the atomic scale, the boundary conditions on the quantum mechanical wavefunctions force very different behavior from what might be expected of the bulk materials. At these boundaries, where everyday intuition breaks down, we are searching for new and unexpected phases and physics. The impact of this research on devices, both larger and small, could be very significant. \nWe are interested in students who enjoy both physics theory and experiment, can think in both real and reciprocal space, and care about both why things are, and what they might be used for. Openings are likely in the area of atomically-engineered materials for energy generation, conversion and storage, and studies of two-dimensional materials and electronic phases in complex oxides.

Prior to Cornell he was the Boeing-Roundhill Professor of Engineering in the Department of Chemical Engineering and an adjunct professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. Jiang pioneered the molecular understanding, design and development of functional zwitterionic materials. Since the early 2000s, his group has proposed the concept of super-hydrophilic zwitterionic materials, provided a molecular-level understanding of non-fouling mechanisms and developed several new classes of zwitterionic materials, including poly(carboxybetaine), poly(sulfobetaine), poly(trimethylamine N-oxide), poly(zwitterionic phosphatidylserine), and glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K)-containing poly(peptides). His group has demonstrated no capsule formation upon subcutaneous implantation in mice for one year, expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) without differentiation, no anti-coagulants needed for artificial lungs in sheep, no antibodies generated against zwitterionic polymers, and environmentally benign marine coatings. These highly biocompatible zwitterionic materials are excellent alternatives to widely used poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) counterparts as PEG immunogenicity was found in COVID-19 vaccines. He co-founded three companies – ZWI Therapeutics, Taproot Medical and Imperion Coatings based on over 50 awarded patents on zwitterionic technologies. Largely resulting from his work, zwitterionic materials have been widely adopted for biomedical and engineering applications.  At Cornell, his group aims to (a) integrate immunology into his biomaterials and drug delivery research programs; (b) translate his biomaterials and drug delivery technologies into medical and engineering practice. Currently, his group performs both basic and applied research integrating science, engineering and medicine, particularly in two areas: (i)  : His group is developing highly biocompatible and immunomodulating materials for the controlled culture of iPSCs and cancer organoids along with capsule-free long-term implants and anticoagulant-free blood-contacting devices in vivo. Similar materials have been applied to anti-fouling marine coatings; (ii)  : His group is developing low-immunogenic and targeted viral and non-viral carriers for the delivery of mRNAs, DNAs, proteins and small molecules for cancer and infectious disease vaccines along with the treatments of several diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases and diabetes.

{"prof_name": "Ruth E. Richardson", "bio": "Richardson joined the faculty in January, 2002, after finishing her Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, where she also received her M.S. Her B.S. in Chemical Engineering was earned at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York. She has had internships as both a Chemical Engineer with Air Products and Chemicals and an Environmental Consultant with Malcolm Pirnie Consultants. She was introduced to laboratory research as an undergraduate through a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Grant, which was awarded to study the pathogenicity of various microorganisms isolated from HIV+ patients at Cornell's Weill Medical College/New York Hospital. \nWhile at Berkeley, she enjoyed tenures as an NSF Graduate Fellow, an EPA STAR (Science to Achieve Results) Fellow, a University of California Toxic Substances Research and Teaching Program Trainee, a Tau Beta Pi Graduate Fellow, and an officer in the Microbiology Graduate Student Group. She also worked with the USEPA and the Army Corps of Engineers on treatability studies at a creosote-contaminated Superfund site in Washington State. Such experiences sparked and nurtured her interests in bioremediation, molecular biology, and the science/policy interface--especially in the areas of chemical and microbial contamination of water and soil. \nAt Cornell, Dr. Richardson's research has focused upon the application of molecular biological tools to improve basic understanding of microbes relevant to bioremediation, sustainable wastewater treatment and sustainable bioenergy and apply this understanding to the deployment of microbial processes in environmental and reactor systems. Dr. Richardson's research group studies the activities of populations within microbial communities through the study of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. While DNA-based techniques still serve as an anchoring point in bioenvironmental engineering, gene presence and characterization only provide insights into potential activity. Instantaneous activity levels are much more tightly tied to RNA and protein (particularly enzymatic proteins). With the wealth of information obtainable by querying RNA and protein pools, it is not only possible to determine whether a particular gene is being expressed under certain conditions, but it is also possible to use the data to develop molecular biomarkers of specific activities in environmental and reactor systems. The main techniques used by the group are quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR) to assay RNA pools, microarrays, and tandem mass spectrometry of biomarker peptides. Together these methods provide a wealth of information about the enzymes and other proteins being expressed by individual populations within a consortium of organisms. The main application of these \"omics\" is the study of consortia containing Dehalococcoides ethenogenes - the first organism shown to bioremediate chlorinated ethenes (perchloroethene - PCE - and trichloroethene - TCE) to harmless ethene gas. The key challenges the lab is focused on are honing the list of key biomarkers of dehalorespiration and quantitatively relating net expression levels to bulk activity (in this case net dehalorespiration rates). Additionally, stress biomarkers can inform bioremediation efforts in the field. Information on in situ stresses felt by key populations can guide site managers to effective actions to take to jump start failing bioremediation efforts. Myriad proteomic techniques are also employed by the lab to better identify key oxidoreductase enzymes expressed by iron and sulfate reducing bacteria that can bioremediate Uranium contamination in groundwater. Another focus in the lab is the growth of high-lipid producing algae as biofuel feedstock. While algae are reported to be up to 100 times more productive per-acre than land plants, and they can be grow on marginal lands and in saline environments (minimizing competition for land for food crops) many challenges still exist with respect to sustainable commercial scale algae growth and harvesting. This research involves genomic and transcriptomic characterization of high-performing marine algal strains being selected for growth in pilot scale facilities.

He received his undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Florida and his Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University, where he worked with Eric Mazur. As a postdoc at the University of California at San Diego, Chris worked with David Kleinfeld in the physics and neuroscience programs. His lab at Cornell develops advanced optical techniques that enable quantitative imaging and targeted manipulation of individual cells in the central nervous system of rodents with the goal of identifying interactions among cells that cause neurological disease. One area of current focus is the role of brain blood flow disruptions in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Prof. Schaffer is also active in developing novel educational strategies to teach science as a dynamic process for discovery. These approaches are used in outreach settings in middle and high-school science classes as well as in his undergraduate and graduate level courses. Chris also has a strong interest in science policy and spent a sabbatical in Washington, DC, working as a science policy advisor for Senator Edward Markey in the United States Congress. Prof. Schaffer's lab develops and uses advanced optical techniques to observe and manipulate in vivo biological systems, with the goal of constructing a microscopic-scale understanding of normal and disease-state physiological processes in the central nervous system. The scientific questions the lab addresses center principally on elucidating the cellular-scale interactions that lead to brain cell dysfunction in neurological diseases. The lab develops novel optical methods that enable these problems to be attacked in ways not previously possible, and because many critical research questions involve interactions among different components of an organism (e.g. effect of altered blood flow on brain cell health) the focus is almost exclusively on in vivo approaches. In summary, the Schaffer lab's efforts center on in vivo experiments investigating the cellular dynamics that underlie neurological disease, supported by the development of novel optical techniques. The lab studies animal models of a variety of neurological diseases, including microvascular stroke, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, and epilepsy. Much of my the lab's work focuses on developing an understanding of the role of cortical microvascular lesions in neurodegenerative disease, and the lab is a leader in the critical effort to determine the mechanisms by which occlusions or hemorrhages in small cortical blood vessels lead to the neuronal damage and neuroinflammation that may drive loss of cognitive function. In exciting new work, the lab is beginning to elucidate the pathways by which cortical microvascular dysfunction interacts with and exacerbates Alzheimer's disease.

{"prof_name": "Fred B. Schneider", "bio": "Fred B. Schneider is Samuel B. Eckert Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University and chair of the department. He joined Cornell's faculty in Fall 1978, having completed a Ph.D. at Stony Brook University and a B.S. in Engineering at Cornell in 1975. \nSchneider's research has focused on various aspects of trustworthy systems --- systems that will perform as expected, despite failures and attacks. His early work concerned formal methods to aid in the design and implementation of concurrent and distributed systems that satisfy their specifications. He is author of two texts on that subject: On Concurrent Programming and (co-authored with D. Gries) A Logical Approach to Discrete Mathematics. He is also known for his research in theory and algorithms for building fault-tolerant distributed systems. His paper on the \"state machine approach\" for managing replication received (in 2007) an SOSP \"Hall of Fame\" award for seminal research. And his paper on fail-stop processors (with Richard Schlichting) received the Jean-Claude Laprie Award in Dependable Computing. More recently, his interests have turned to system security. His work characterizing what policies can be enforced with various classes of defenses is widely cited, and it is seen as advancing the nascent science base for security. He is also engaged in research concerning legal and economic measures for improving system trustworthiness. \nSchneider was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1992), the Association of Computing Machinery (1995), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (2008). He was named Professor-at-Large at the University of Tromso (Norway) in 1996 and was awarded a Doctor of Science honoris causa by the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 2003 for his work in computer dependability and security. He received the 2012 IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award for \"contributions to trustworthy computing through novel approaches to security, fault-tolerance and formal methods for concurrent and distributed systems\". The U.S. National Academy of Engineering elected Schneider to membership in 2011, the Norges Tekniske Vitenskapsakademi (Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences) named him a foreign member in 2010, and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences elected him to membership in 2017. \nSchneider chaired the National Academies Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) study on information systems trustworthiness that produced the 1999 volume Trust in Cyberspace. He is currently a member of the National Academies Naval Studies Board, Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, Defense Science Board, and is founding chair of the National Academies Forum on Cyber Resillience. \nIn 2007, Schneider was elected to the board of directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA) and served through 2016. During that period, he was a member of CRA's Computing Community Consortium steering committee 2007-2013 and chaired the Government Affairs committee. In Fall 2011, he started the CCC/CRA Leadership in Science Policy Institute, which still runs biannually. \nSchneider is a frequent consultant to industry, believing this to be an efficient method of technology transfer and a good way to learn about the real problems. He provides technical expertise in fault-tolerance and computer security to a variety of other firms, including Intel, Lincoln Laboratories, NTREPID, and ZeroFox. In addition, Schneider has testified about cybersecurity research at hearings of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee (subcommittee on Terrorism, Unconventional Threats, and Capabilities), as well as the Committee on Science and Technology (subcommittee on Technology and Innovation and subcommittee on Research and Science Education).", "research_interests": [{"text": "Security ", "link": "/security"}, {"text": "Programming Languages - CS", "link": "/programming-languages-cs"}, {"text": "Systems and Networking ", "link": "/systems-and-networking"}, {"text": "Complex Systems, Network Science and Computation", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/complex-systems-network-science-and-computation"}, {"text": "Cloud and Distributed Computing", "link": "/cloud-and-distributed-computing"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "Gries, David Joseph, Fred Barry Schneider.  1993. A Logical Approach to Discrete Math.  : 497. New York, United States: Springer Verlag.", "hyperlink": null}, {"text": "Schneider, Fred Barry.  2017. \"A computer scientist musing about the DNC hack.

After receiving a B.S. degree from Caltech, he did graduate work at Stanford University receiving an M.S. in Electrical Engineering and a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering. He was then a post-doc at IBM's research lab in Zurich, Switzerland in the oxide superconductors and novel materials group managed by Nobel Prize winners J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller. In 1992 he joined the faculty at Penn State in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, where he spent 16 years before joining the faculty at Cornell in 2008. His research interests involve the heteroepitaxial growth and characterization of oxide thin films by reactive molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), especially utilizing a 'materials-by-design' approach to the discovery of materials with properties superior to any known. His group synthesizes these oxide heterostructures using molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). He has published over 700 papers and 12 patents resulting in an h-index of 94 and over 46,000 citations. His work has been recognized by the highest awards for materials discovery by four relevant societies: the MRS Medal from the Materials Research Society, the Frank Prize from the International Organization for Crystal Growth, the McGroddy Prize from the American Physical Society, and the John A. Thornton Memorial Award/Lecture from the American Vacuum Society. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the Materials Research Society, the American Vacuum Society, and is a member of the National Academy of Engineering. Prof. Schlom was named the Tisch University Professor in 2023. The focus of my group's research is investigating and perfecting the properties of oxide materials for electronic uses. To do this, we grow oxide thin films on single crystal substrates of closely related substances. The single crystal substrate provides a structural template for the thin films that we grow. The films follow this atomic template and are thus said to be epitaxial (inheriting their crystalline arrangement from the underlying substrate). Our focus on oxides is due to the tremendous promise that these materials hold for electrical applications. Oxides exhibit an unparalleled variety of electronic properties. Insulating, semiconducting, and even superconducting oxides all exist within the set of structurally compatible oxides known as perovskites. This structurally related family also includes oxides that are magnetic, ferroelectric, or even both at the same time.

Concurrently to performing this research, he received his M.B.A. (2009) at U of I and started a company, worked with several other startups, and gained significant experience with the details of market research, financials, accounting issues, and legal aspects of entrepreneurship. In 2010, he continued his education as a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University in George Whitesides's research group in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. In this group, he developed pneumatic actuators in soft elastomers that took the form of a machine capable of moving in multiple gaits: walking and undulating. These actuators have also been used for low-cost manipulators, and in concert with a microfluidic system for biomimetic camouflage & display.

Her goal is to contribute to science-based societal transformation, a global low-carbon circular economy, and sustainable development through transdisciplinary research, education, and actions with impact. Before coming to Cornell University, she was a Full Professor in energy systems planning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, where she established and led the Energy and Climate Division of the Energy Technology Department for twelve years. During this time, she also acted as KTH director of international cooperation with Brazil and other Latin American countries and coordinated cooperation with the UNFCCC and UNCTAD. She is a faculty fellow of Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. Her work on sustainability grew from a conceptual basis towards an agenda for action, connecting technology, planning, and policy to steer societal transformation. This has taken her to transdisciplinary research and cooperation with multiple stakeholders. She collaborates with partners outside academia and brings real-world cases to the classroom. She has developed and managed projects in collaboration with academics, multi-lateral organizations, government, and the private sector in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Previously, she worked as a sustainability and climate expert at the Swedish Energy Agency, and program manager for energy and climate at the Stockholm Environment Institute. She did research at MIT, IIASA (International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis), University of Tübingen, and the University of Stockholm. Professor Silveira has acted in various company boards of directors, and advisory committees including the Swedish Royal Academy of Science, Swedish Research Council, Finnish Academy of Sciences, among others. She recently received an honorary medal from the Brazilian Embassy in Stockholm for her extensive work in promoting the cooperation between Sweden and Brazil. She won the Jabuti literature Prize 2001 in Brazil for the book Electricity for Sustainable Development (in Portuguese). She is also the author of various journal articles and books including an anthology of the Swedish energy system, \"Building sustainable energy systems – Swedish experiences\", and the book \"Bioenergy – realizing the potential\".

{"prof_name": "Alexandra Coso Strong", "bio": "Alexandra Coso Strong works and teaches at the intersection of engineering education, faculty development, and complex systems design. She joined Cornell University in 2024 after co-founding the School of Universal Computing, Construction and Engineering Education at Florida International University (FIU). As an assistant professor at FIU, she co-developed two degree programs, a Ph.D. in Engineering and Computing Education and a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Engineering. In addition, she held appointments in the STEM Transformation Institute, the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, and the Department of Teaching and Learning.  Strong completed her doctorate in aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech in 2014. While a doctoral student, Strong was a National Science Foundation graduate research fellow and a member of the Cognitive Engineering Center. The goal of her doctorate research was to improve students’ abilities to think more broadly about complex systems design and to take into account stakeholder-related considerations within their design projects. Prior to attending Georgia Tech, Strong received a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from MIT (2007) and a master’s degree in systems engineering from the University of Virginia (2010). For her master’s degree work, she developed a mixed methods research design to examine undergraduate engineering students’ prior knowledge about interdisciplinary approaches to design and problem-solving. Strong continued her educational and professional journey as a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech’s Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning and a faculty member at Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts (2015-2018).  Grounded in the growing complexity of ongoing global challenges, Strong’s research focuses on identifying and developing approaches to (a) sustainable change with the systems we inhabit and interact with and (b) how we, as educators, can prepare the next generation of engineers and change agents to develop solutions to these challenges. In recognition of her research accomplishments and future vision, Strong earned an NSF CAREER Award in 2023 to identify, learn from, and amplify the stories of educators who have developed transformational curricular designs while facing barriers that have impeded change in other contexts. Within the field of engineering education, she was appointed to the the American Society for Engineering Education’s (ASEE) Presidential Task Force on Graduate Education (2019 – 2021) and elected to serve as a Director of ASEE’s Educational Research and Methods (ERM) Division (2016-2018). She currently serves as an Associate Editor for Studies in Engineering Education (2020-Present). Together, with a diverse group of emerging scholars, we established the Research on Engineering, Design, and Educational Systems (REDES) team.

We seek to formulate medical imaging problems for disease diagnosis and therapy delivery as inverse problems, deducing underlying pathogeneses from acquired signals based on biophysics. We work closely with clinicians to study neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, as well as cancer in various organs, liver diseases, and heart diseases. These inverse problems are often poorly conditioned and involve noisy incomplete data, resulting in reconstructed images with errors or artifacts commonly encountered in computer vision. We have developed the Bayesian solutions for these inverse problems, drawing from prior knowledge established in biomedicine or acquired from multiple imaging modalities, including immunohistochemical staining and optical imaging.

Watson", "bio": "Chekesha Liddell received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with Highest Distinction from Spelman College (1999) and a Bachelor of Materials Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology (1999), [Atlanta University Center, Dual Degree Engineering Program]. She was awarded the NASA Women in Science and Engineering Scholarship to support her undergraduate work including an honors thesis on the Synthesis and Characterization of m-Aminobenzenarsonic acid, an important standard for understanding the metabolysis of arsenic in poultry. Liddell also held three internship appointments at NASA, Kennedy Space Center in the Cryogenics and External Tank Branch and the Microchemical Analysis Laboratories. She joined the Cornell University faculty in November of 2003, after receiving a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering with a minor in Science and Technology Policy from Georgia Tech. Liddell's awards for scholarly achievement include the National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award [Nonspherical, Active, and \"Inverted\" Bases for Optimized Photonic Crystal Design] (2006); Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Sciences Career Initiation Grant, (2003); Office of Naval Research Graduate Fellowship (1999-2003); Georgia Tech President's Fellowship, (1999-2003); Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Sciences Fellowship (1999-2003); NSBE, National Society of Black Engineers Fellow, (2000); Hertz Foundation Fellowship Grant, (1999); TMS materials society, J.

Liddell is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the American Chemical Society, the Materials Research Society, the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) and the Cornell Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS). The Liddell group research efforts focus on the development of colloid-based materials [using synthetic chemistry, surface modification, self-assembly and field-directed assembly] and on understanding the relationship between their structure and properties to provide engineering solutions for the micron and submicron length scales. We integrate fundamental science in the areas of inorganic and organic chemistry, interface science, materials science (principles for electronic, optical, magnetic, mechanical behavior of materials), condensed matter physics, and thermodynamics to design and fabricate materials for applications requiring low cost manufacture with performance tied to control of micro- and nanostructures. In particular, we address the limitations in achieving optimum photonic crystal materials for photonic technologies such as optical integrated circuits, light sources, photocatalysts, and solar cells. Photonic crystals [PCs, photonic bandgap (PBG) materials, periodic dielectrics] modify the dispersion relations and strongly affect the distribution of electromagnetic modes within dielectric materials, offering unique control of light; for example, enhanced or inhibited spontaneous emission of molecules and \"super\"-prism beam steering effects, with large angular dispersion (>50º) observed for small wavelength differences (~10nm). \nOur work addresses the central challenge in the photonic crystal field, to develop inexpensive fine-scale periodic materials with sizable PBGs or large partial PBGs (stopbands) at visible and near-IR frequencies. Calculations indicate the materials design characteristics favorable for this achievement include a sub-micron lattice constant, a high refractive index contrast (high-n) between periodic regions, low optical absorption, and low filling fraction of high-n material (ordered porous structure). The crystal structure and shape and complexity of the photonic crystal basis also greatly influence the capability of photonic crystals to exhibit PBGs, by removing symmetry induced degeneracy in the photonic bands. For the past 15 years experimental achievements have been mainly limited to simple inverted face-centered cubic (FCC) structures templated from close-packed spheres due to [1] the lack of availability of non-spherical particles with consistent size and shape (CV<5%) in a variety of chemistries and [2] the lack of processes for particle orientation control which would lead to complex topologies and new lattice structures. Because of the spherical symmetry at lattice points, the inverted FCC structure exhibits weak light-matter interactions and fragile bandgaps (5% width as given by gap-midgap ratio) which close with minor structural disorder. \nWe create complex colloidal crystals from buildings blocks with diverse morphology [i.e., non-spherical, core-shell] and with functionality [i.e., fluorescent, magnetic]. Our experiments investigate the effects of colloid particle chemistry, shape, size, packing, orientation, and refractive index on photonic band structures and the resulting optical properties of photonic crystals with the ultimate goal of developing new functional (beyond passive waveguiding) photonic crystal structures.

{"prof_name": "Yadong Wang", "bio": "Yadong Wang obtained his Ph.D. degree at Stanford University in 1999, performed his postdoctoral studies at MIT, and joined the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2003 as an assistant professor. He was recruited to Pittsburgh in 2008. He has published high-impact articles at every stage of his academic career in journals including Science, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Medicine, and PNAS. Several of his inventions are licensed, one polymer he invented is now commercially available and approved for clinical use. He co-founded two companies to translate the technologies developed in his laboratory. His research focuses on creating biomaterials that will solve key challenges in the cardiovascular, nervous and musculoskeletal systems. His team enjoys collaboration with others who share the same passion for translational research. The Wang Lab's most mature project is artery tissue engineering. We use a biodegradable elastomer to guide cells to make living arterial tissues as the polymer degrades. The unique design of the polymer allows the synthesis of a substantial amount of elastin quickly in the engineered arterial tissue, which had been a key challenge in tissue engineering. In order to facilitate clinical translation, we refined our approach to eliminate the need of cell seeding prior to the implantation of the arterial graft. Now the transformation from a synthetic polymeric tube into an elastic artery-like tissue occurs completely in the recipient body within a few months after implantation. This broke new grounds in tissue engineering and was reported in Nature Medicine in 2012. Science Translational Medicine called the work \"a departure from traditional tissue engineering\". We are testing this in ovine and porcine models for application in peripheral arterial diseases, dialysis access and eventually coronary artery diseases. Our project on controlled drug delivery focuses on protein drugs. The only successful protein drugs are those of long half-lives, such as insulin and growth hormones. Growth factors are potent molecules that guides the essential cell functions including proliferation, differentiation, and migration. However, their short half-lives have limited their clinical use over the last few decades. Heparin binds many growth factors and greatly extends their half-lives in vivo. However, [heparin:growth factor] complexes are soluble in water and will spread throughout the body inducing significant side effects. We designed a biocompatible polycation that conjugate heparin and induce phase separation (termed complex coacervation) of the [heparin:growth factor] complex. The resultant precipitate enables spatial and temporal control of the release of the growth factors, increasing the efficacy while reducing the side effects. We have recently embarked on a project in regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM). With the strong developmental biology expertise at Cornell, my lab will expand beyond synthetic polymeric biomaterials. Many evolutionarily simpler species have amazing regeneration capabilities. A well-known example is the limb regeneration of newt. Cells are undoubtedly important for this regeneration. However, in many cases, cell fate is controlled by the ECM. ECM has been investigated in regeneration medicine for decades. However, the focus of the field is on mammalian ECM. Many target organs in regenerative medicine, such as the heart and central nerve, do not regenerate in mammals. Instead, mammalian default repair mechanism in these organs is fibrosis. I believe it is possible to harvest the regenerative capability of primitive species using their ECM. When properly decellularized, the ECM will keep many of the signaling molecules that controls cell function. Thus using a healing ECM from a primitive species will likely help mammalian tissues to regenerate. Moving forward, I would like to initiate a project in collaboration with the computation experts at Cornell. With the presence of a very strong polymer science community at Cornell, I envision that close collaborations with polymer scientists will create biomaterials with more precise control over properties and more diverse functions. Clear guiding principles in biomaterials design and development are still elusive. A strong materiomics project that couples computation and experiments will advance this aspect of biomaterials science. I believe collectively biomaterials field has sufficient data on materials-biology interfaces that computational models will provide useful guidance on materials design.", "research_interests": [{"text": "Biomedical Engineering", "link": "/biomedical-engineering"}, {"text": "Bioengineering", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/bioengineering"}, {"text": "Advanced Materials", "link": "/research-and-faculty/strategic-areas-research/advanced-materials"}, {"text": "Drug Delivery and Nanomedicine", "link": "/drug-delivery-and-nanomedicine"}, {"text": "Tissue Engineering and Biomaterials", "link": "/tissue-engineering-biomaterials"}], "selected_publications": [{"text": "Wang, Yadong, J.

Then, for six years through 1975, he was a research scientist at The Radio and Space Research Station, Science Research Council, Ditton Park, United Kingdom (now The Appleton-Rutherford Laboratory). After earning his doctorate (University College, London, 1975), he became a senior project associate for the Department of Aerospace Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University, where he also worked with the Meteorology Department. Since 1977 he has been at Cornell University. Zellman Warhaft conducts basic wind tunnel experiments on particles in turbulence in order to understand the dynamics of raindrops in clouds. He collaborates with experts on Lagrangian tracking of inertial particles (Bodenschatz (Goettingen), Voth (Wesleyan)), and on the cloud physics (Shaw (Michigan)), Seibert, (Leipzig)). His interest in this area was stimulated by his work on the effect of weather on microwave radio propagation (Melbourne '67-'69) and on related problems at Ditton Park ('69- '75). He maintained this contact with geophysics, an area in which turbulent transport is vitally important. In '72, he worked with the air-sea interaction tunnel of the IMST (Marseille). When he was at Penn State ('75-'77) he had close ties to the Meterology Dept. After coming to Cornell, he has spent a sabbatical at KNMI de Bilt (The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute). His present interests are in the fundamentals of the small-scale structure of the scalar and velocity fields in high Reynolds number turbulent flows and the effects of turbulence on the formation of raindrops in clouds. ZW is actively involved with diversity issues across the university: he was Provost Fellow addressing faculty diversity (2010-2011) and Associate Dean for Diversity in the Engineering College (2003-2007). He is also engaged in the environmental matters: he was Chair of the Faculty Advisory Board for the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF), 2010-2011. He co-chaired conferences on wind power at Cornell in 2009 and 2010. He also teaches courses on sustainable energy. ZW is also concerned with the social aspects of engineering and (apart from his more formal teaching obligations) taught for many years a course on this topic called \"Components and Systems: Engineering in a Social Context\". Through case studies, he illustrated that engineering is very much a social activity and that the modern engineer must be more involved with the social and environmental implications of his or her work.

{"prof_name": "Uli B. Wiesner", "bio": " studied Chemistry at the University of Mainz, Germany, and UC Irvine, CA, US. He gained his Ph.D. in 1991 in Physical Chemistry with work at the Max-Planck-Institute for Polymer Research (MPI-P), Mainz, Germany, on holographic information storage in polymer liquid crystals. After a two-year postdoc at E.S.P.C.I. in Paris, France, on local dynamics-mechanical property correlations in polyesters, he returned to the MPI-P in 1993 were he finished his Habilitation and received tenure in 1998 with work on block copolymers under oscillatory shear and block copolymer ionomers. He joined the Cornell University, NY, MS&E faculty in 1999 as a tenured Associate Professor, became a Full Professor in 2005, and since 2008 is the Spencer T. Olin Professor of Engineering. Since his arrival at Cornell he has worked at the interface between polymer science and inorganic/solid-state chemistry with the goal to generate multifunctional nanomaterials for applications including energy conversion and storage, clean water, and nanomedicine. Since 2015 he is the co-director of the MSKCC-Cornell Center for Translation of Cancer Nanomedicine (MC TCN), one of six Centers for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence (CCNE) funded by the NCI ( ) The goal of current research in the Wiesner group is to combine knowledge about the self-assembly of soft polymeric materials with the functionality of solid-state materials to generate novel hierarchical and multifunctional hybrid materials. Research results of the group on the use of blocked copolymers as structure directing agents for inorganic materials suggest that in analogy to biology, the sequence information of higher order blocked synthetic macromolecular architectures may be used to encode information about hierarchical structure of co-assemblies with ceramic or other materials. These principles may permit the design of entirely new classes of functional materials that have no analogue in the natural world with potential applications ranging from power generation and energy conversion all the way to the life sciences. As a particular model system to understand structure formation principles, silica-based hybrids from block copolymer mesophases have been studied extensively over the last ten years. One of the main working principles involves utilizing the thermodynamics of amphiphilic block copolymers, i.e., knowledge about their self-assembly behavior (bottom-up) to structure direct precursors for silica-type oxides. In the meantime these principles have been extended to other oxides as well as to non-oxide ceramics (e.g., SiCN). Synthesis results in mesostructured hybrid materials with structure control down to the nanometer length scale that upon, e.g., thermal processing can subsequently be converted into purely ceramic materials with preserved structure (e.g., mesoporous materials). The final materials have a broad range of potential applications in, e.g., catalysis and separation. A second major current research direction of the Wiesner group focuses on a novel class of fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, now referred to as C-dots, with potential applications, e.g., as fluorescent labels in biolabeling and bioimaging.

Research results of the group on the use of blocked copolymers as structure directing agents for inorganic materials suggest that in analogy to biology, the sequence information of higher order blocked synthetic macromolecular architectures may be used to encode information about hierarchical structure of co-assemblies with ceramic or other materials. These principles may permit the design of entirely new classes of functional materials that have no analogue in the natural world with potential applications ranging from power generation and energy conversion all the way to the life sciences.", "As a particular model system to understand structure formation principles, silica-based hybrids from block copolymer mesophases have been studied extensively over the last ten years. One of the main working principles involves utilizing the thermodynamics of amphiphilic block copolymers, i.e., knowledge about their self-assembly behavior (bottom-up) to structure direct precursors for silica-type oxides. In the meantime these principles have been extended to other oxides as well as to non-oxide ceramics (e.g., SiCN). Synthesis results in mesostructured hybrid materials with structure control down to the nanometer length scale that upon, e.g., thermal processing can subsequently be converted into purely ceramic materials with preserved structure (e.g., mesoporous materials). The final materials have a broad range of potential applications in, e.g., catalysis and separation.", "A second major current research direction of the Wiesner group focuses on a novel class of fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticles, now referred to as C-dots, with potential applications, e.g., as fluorescent labels in biolabeling and bioimaging.

{"prof_name": "Alexandra Werth", "bio": "Alexandra Werth is an assistant professor at the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, having joined the faculty in Fall 2023. Her work focuses on Engineering Education Research (EER), a branch of discipline-based education research (DBER) that examines the unique educational aspects within engineering contexts. She is particularly interested in developing evidence-based teaching methodologies and educational tools to foster authentic learning environments. Dr. Werth is both an education researcher and trained engineer, holding dual bachelor's degrees in engineering and physics from Swarthmore College, as well as a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Princeton University. During her doctoral studies, she specialized in developing a non-invasive mid-infrared glucose sensor using quantum cascade laser spectroscopy for diabetes management. Subsequently, she pursued postdoctoral research at the University of Colorado Boulder in physics education research, with a specific focus on undergraduate instructional labs. Notably, she played a pivotal role in developing, implementing, and assessing the first large-enrollment introductory physics course-based research experience (CURE). Dr. Werth's research is dedicated to advancing evidence-based teaching practices and tools to enhance access to and efficacy of authentic learning environments. She focuses particularly on disciplinary-based research within engineering contexts, with a specific interest in biomedical engineering, although her work often transcends disciplinary boundaries. Her work delves into three interconnected components of the educational system: (1) Values: Through the BEEAR research group, Dr. Werth seeks to understand the values of engineers and how these values manifest as learning objectives in engineering curricula. She investigates potential variations in these values across engineering disciplines and their distinctions from those in other experimental sciences. (2) Pedagogy: Dr. Werth explores innovative pedagogical approaches aimed at engaging and inspiring engineering students while simultaneously fostering essential skills such as teamwork, technical proficiency, creativity, innovation, and the application of fundamental scientific knowledge to engineering challenges. (3) Assessment: The BEEAR research group endeavors to develop research-based assessment instruments to gauge the effectiveness of engineering education interventions. These assessment tools enable instructors and researchers to gain insights into students' learning processes. Dr. Werth and her team create and refine these instruments to gather reliable data and provide evidence-based recommendations for enhancing engineering education. Through continual refinement and adaptation of assessment methods, they strive to contribute to the ongoing improvement of engineering education practices.", "research_interests": [{"text": "Engineering Education", "link": "/engineering-education"}, "Dr. Werth's research is dedicated to advancing evidence-based teaching practices and tools to enhance access to and efficacy of authentic learning environments.

{"prof_name": "Matthew J. Paszek", "bio": "Matthew began his scientific career as an undergraduate in the School of Chemical Engineering at Cornell University. Upon receiving his B.S. from Cornell, Matthew went on to pursue a Ph.D. in Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania under the mentorship of Professors Daniel Hammer and Valerie Weaver. There he conducted experimental and theoretical work that identified increased tissue stiffness and enhanced tumor cell contractility as key driving forces of cancer progression. Matthew then moved to the University of California, San Francisco under the mentorship of Valerie Weaver, where he began his work in glycobiology and developed Scanning Angle Interference Microscopy, a powerful tool for imaging live cells at the nanoscale. In 2013, Matthew returned to Cornell University as a Kavli Fellow under the mentorship of Professor's Abraham Stroock and Claudia Fischbach, and worked on the development of high speed, custom optoelectronics for nanoscale cellular imaging. In the Spring of 2014, Matthew joined the Cornell faculty as an Assistant Professor in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. His current researches focuses on how chemistry and mechanics are coupled in living systems. The hardware for intracellular signal transduction consists of thousands of membrane receptors and signaling molecules carefully arranged throughout the cell. Notably, the cell expends the majority of its energy maintaining its biomolecules in spatial arrangements outside of thermodynamic equilibrium. The Paszek group investigates how signaling patterns emerge from these spatial arrangements and what role mechanical forces and biophysical interactions play in organizing biomolecules at molecular length scales. In essence, we seek to understand how life works at tiny, nanometer length scales. \nAn active area of research by our group is in the biological frontier of glycobiology. Every living cell in the body is coated with a sugary film called the glycocalyx. We are currently investigating how these sugars spatially configure the machinery of signal transduction. In cancer, we've discovered that these sugars are anything but sweet, and play a major role in the development of aggressive, lethal cancers. Our hope is to understand how these sugars modify signaling in disease specific contexts, such as cancer, and what role metabolism plays in organizing signaling molecules through regulation of these sugars.

From late 2011 through 2013, he was on leave serving as NASA's Chief Technologist, one of the seven highest-ranking officials at the agency. In that capacity, he served as the primary advisor to the NASA Administrator on matters of technology-investment strategy, roadmapping, prioritization, partnerships, intellectual property, and commercialization. The Office of the Chief Technologist is home to the agency's Technology Transfer enterprise, the Innovative Partnerships Office, Prizes and Challenges Strategy Office, and Emerging Space Office. His work with NASA since 2011 has included collaborations in space-policy development with the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government. Examples include new technology initiatives at the agency, including the Asteroid Grand Challenge and the program in Foundational Investments in Engineering Science. \nHis areas of academic expertise include next-generation space-system architectures, mission design, and GNC. His background represents a breadth of leadership experience in space technology across academia, the aerospace industry, and DoD. It extends from early-stage theoretical work through flight hardware and mission operations. His research has been funded by DARPA, AFOSR, NASA, and U.S. aerospace prime contractors. \nPeck has been a member of the Guidance, Navigation, and Control Technical Discipline Team of the NASA Engineering Safety Council since 2009. He also has worked as a consultant in advanced technology and business development for spacecraft contractors including Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin. In addition to this ongoing consulting work, he has over 10 years' experience in the aerospace industry, primarily at Boeing Satellite Systems (the former Hughes Space and Communications), where his responsibilities included commercial and government spacecraft systems engineering as well as mission operations for several spacecraft. At Honeywell, he served as Principal Fellow, the most senior engineering position in the company, focusing on technology strategy, new business, and special programs. He has 19 patents in space technology that stem from this work. \nRecognized for his teaching and mentorship at Cornell, Peck created and directed the Space Systems Design Studio, in which many students and staff collaborate on several Air Force and NASA-funded flight programs. His work with small spacecraft (three launched since 2012) has included collaborations at JPL, Draper Lab, and Lockheed, as well as academic institutions. His lab's KickSat, launched in April 2014, is the world's first crowdfunded spacecraft. His space technology blog at http://www.spacecraftlab.com and recent television and radio interviews have given Peck the opportunity to share his enthusiasm for exploration with the public.
